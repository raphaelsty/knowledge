It is meant to be used in high-throughput environments, as well as TinyML systems. This library is complementary to Riverhttpsgithub.comonline-mlriver. The latter provides a wide array of online methods, but is not ideal when it comes to performance. The idea is to take the algorithms that work best in River, and implement them in a way that is more performant. As such, LightRiver is not meant to be a general purpose library. It is meant to be a fast online machine learning library that provides a few algorithms that are known to work well in online settings. This is a akin to the way scikit-learnhttpsscikit-learn.org and LightGBMhttpslightgbm.readthedocs.ioenstable are complementary to each other.",

In this work, we propose to explicitly mark the terms that exactly match between the query and the document in the input of BERT, assuming that it is capable of learning how to integrate the exact matching signal when estimating the relevance.

The most straight-forward way for this is answer aware question generation. In answer aware question generation the model is presented with the answer and the passage and asked to generate a question for that answer by considering the passage context. While there are many papers available for QG task, it's still not as mainstream as QA. One of the reasons is most of the earlier papers use complicated modelsprocessing pipelines and have no pre-trained models available. Few recent papers, specifically UniLM and ProphetNet have SOTA pre-trained weights availble for QG but the usage seems quite complicated.",

The idea is that we are able to stress one or more variables and observe how a machine learning model reacts to the stress. The stress is based on a statistical re-weighting scheme called entropic variable projection. The main benefit of our method is that it will only consider realistic scenarios, and will not build fake examples.

Being a stronger form of data augmentation, AugMax leads to a significantly augmented input distribution which makes model training more challenging. To solve this problem, we further design a disentangled normalization module, termed DuBIN Dual-Batch-and-Instance Normalization that disentangles the instance-wise feature heterogeneity arising from AugMax. AugMax-DuBIN leads to significantly improved out-of-distribution robustness, outperforming prior arts by 3.03, 3.49, 1.82 and 0.71 on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, Tiny ImageNet-C and ImageNet-C.",

However, writing a set of codes for each instruction set architecture is very poor in maintainability and scalability. As these codes increases, The cost of community maintenance is getting higher, there is an urgent need for a general-purpose instruction set optimization technical solution that can be promoted.

OPUS-Fold is based on torsion-angle sampling. After each sampling step, it reconstructs the structure and estimates the model quality with an energy function that is formed by combining many different constraining terms designed either by ourselves or by others in literature. OPUS-Fold balances the accuracy and the efficiency, delivers good results in a short time, and leaves more space for including the results of other subproblem methods. Moreover, OPUS-Fold also contains a fast side-chain modeling method OPUS-Rota2 J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15 9, 5154-5160, which enables a speedy construction of all-atom atomic models during the folding process that allows the usage of all-atom-required subproblem methods. In summary, OPUS-Fold provides a protein folding platform for incorporating the results from various subproblem methods, including those containing non-differentiable information such as partial experimental data.",

When faceswapping was first developed and published, the technology was groundbreaking, it was a huge step in AI development. It was also completely ignored outside of academia because the code was confusing and fragmentary. It required a thorough understanding of complicated AI techniques and took a lot of effort to figure it out. Until one individual brought it together into a single, cohesive collection. It ran, it worked, and as is so often the way with new technology emerging on the internet, it was immediately used to create inappropriate content. Despite the inappropriate uses the software was given originally, it was the first AI code that anyone could download, run and learn by experimentation without having a Ph.D. in math, computer theory, psychology, and more.

Different from previous image-to-image translation methods that formulate the translation as pixel-wise prediction, we deal with such an artistic creation process in a vectorized environment and produce a sequence of physically meaningful stroke parameters that can be further used for rendering. Since a typical vector render is not differentiable, we design a novel neural renderer which imitates the behavior of the vector renderer and then frame the stroke prediction as a parameter searching process that maximizes the similarity between the input and the rendering output. Experiments show that the paintings generated by our method have a high degree of fidelity in both global appearance and local textures. Our method can be also jointly optimized with neural style transfer that further transfers visual style from other images.",

Contents Collaboration requires agents to coordinate their behavior on the fly, sometimes cooperating to solve a single task together and other times dividing it up into sub-tasks to work on in parallel. Underlying the human ability to collaborate is theory-of-mind, the ability to infer the hidden mental states that drive others to act. Here, we develop Bayesian Delegation, a decentralized multi-agent learning mechanism with these abilities. Bayesian Delegation enables agents to rapidly infer the hidden intentions of others by inverse planning. We test Bayesian Delegation in a suite of multi-agent Markov decision processes inspired by cooking problems. On these tasks, agents with Bayesian Delegation coordinate both their high-level plans e.g. what sub-task they should work on and their low-level actions e.g. avoiding getting in each others way. In a self-play evaluation, Bayesian Delegation outperforms alternative algorithms. Bayesian Delegation is also a capable ad-hoc collaborator and successfully coordinates with other agent types even in the absence of prior experience. Finally, in a behavioral experiment, we show that Bayesian Delegation makes inferences similar to human observers about the intent of others. Together, these results demonstrate the power of Bayesian Delegation for decentralized multi-agent collaboration.",

Denoising score matching with Annealed Langevin Sampling DSM-ALShttpsarxiv.orgabs2006.09011 is a recent approach to generative modeling. Despite the convincing visual quality of samples, this method appears to perform worse than Generative Adversarial Networks GANs under the Frechet Inception Distance, a popular metric forgenerative models. We show that this apparent gap vanishes when denoising thefinal Langevin samples using the score network. In addition, we propose two improvements to DSM-ALS 1 Consistent Annealed Sampling as a more stable alternative to Annealed Langevin Sampling, and 2 a hybrid training formulation, composed of both denoising score matching and adversarial objectives. By combining both of these techniques and exploring different network architectures, we elevate score matching methods and obtain results competitive with state-of-the-art image generation on CIFAR-10",

However, I think it could be helpful to share it with others and I'm expecting useful discussions on my implementations. But I didn't spend much time on cleaning or structuring the code. As you may notice that there may be several versions of implementation for each algorithm, I intentionally show all of them here for you to refer and compare.

You can avoid the traditional edit-compile-run cycle, which often interrupts workflow. Instead, you can write and execute small snippets of code, gradually developing them into a complete project without the need to switch contexts. The lines between your editor and interpreter blur seamlessly.",

This means that we are not confined to the assumption that features given their respective y's follow the Gaussian distribution, but also the categorical distribution. Hence it is natural that the continuous data be attributed to the Gaussian and the categorical data nominal or ordinal be attributed the the categorical distribution.",

Recent trends of incorporating attention mechanisms in vision have led researchers to reconsider the supremacy of convolutional layers as a primary building block. Beyond helping CNNs to handle long-range dependencies, Ramachandran et al. 2019 showed that attention can completely replace convolution and achieve state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. This raises the question do learned attention layers operate similarly to convolutional layers? This work provides evidence that attention layers can perform convolution and, indeed, they often learn to do so in practice. Specifically, we prove that a multi-head self-attention layer with sufficient number of heads is at least as powerful as any convolutional layer. Our numerical experiments then show that the phenomenon also occurs in practice, corroborating our analysis. Our code is publicly available.",

We study variations in how documents and their identifiers\nare represented, variations in training procedures, and the interplay between\nmodels and corpus sizes. Experiments demonstrate that given appropriate design\nchoices, DSI significantly outperforms strong baselines such as dual encoder\nmodels. Moreover, DSI demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,\noutperforming a BM25 baseline in a zero-shot setup.",

Understanding the signal $x$ requires more than just predicting $y$, it\nalso requires specifying which features of $\\X$ play a role in the prediction.\nWe formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for $\\X$ that\npreserves the maximum information about $\\Y$. That is, we squeeze the\ninformation that $\\X$ provides about $\\Y$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a\nlimited set of codewords $\\tX$. This constrained optimization problem can be\nseen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion\nmeasure $d(x,\\x)$ emerges from the joint statistics of $\\X$ and $\\Y$. This\napproach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules\n$X \\to \\tX$ and $\\tX \\to \\Y$.

Specifically, our proposed model has strong empirical\nevidence as it obtains SOTA results on Natural Questions, a new benchmark MRC\ndataset, outperforming BERT-LARGE by 3 F1 points on short answer prediction. We\nalso establish a new SOTA in HotpotQA, improving answer prediction F1 by 4 F1\npoints and supporting fact prediction by 1 F1 point.

However, existing methods only exploit entity information in\npretraining and do not explicitly use entities in downstream tasks. In this\nstudy, we explore the effectiveness of leveraging entity representations for\ndownstream cross-lingual tasks. We train a multilingual language model with 24\nlanguages with entity representations and show the model consistently\noutperforms word-based pretrained models in various cross-lingual transfer\ntasks. We also analyze the model and the key insight is that incorporating\nentity representations into the input allows us to extract more\nlanguage-agnostic features. We also evaluate the model with a multilingual\ncloze prompt task with the mLAMA dataset. We show that entity-based prompt\nelicits correct factual knowledge more likely than using only word\nrepresentations.

We find that unsatisfactory\nperformance is mainly due to the static token embeddings biases and the\nineffective BERT layers, rather than the high cosine similarity of the sentence\nembeddings. To this end, we propose a prompt based sentence embeddings method\nwhich can reduce token embeddings biases and make the original BERT layers more\neffective. By reformulating the sentence embeddings task as the\nfillin-the-blanks problem, our method significantly improves the performance of\noriginal BERT. We discuss two prompt representing methods and three prompt\nsearching methods for prompt based sentence embeddings. Moreover, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised training objective by the technology of template denoising,\nwhich substantially shortens the performance gap between the supervised and\nunsupervised setting. For experiments, we evaluate our method on both non\nfine-tuned and fine-tuned settings. Even a non fine-tuned method can outperform\nthe fine-tuned methods like unsupervised ConSERT on STS tasks. Our fine-tuned\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art method SimCSE in both unsupervised and\nsupervised settings. Compared to SimCSE, we achieve 2.29 and 2.58 points\nimprovements on BERT and RoBERTa respectively under the unsupervised setting.",

This\npaper poses the question: given this recent progress, and limited human\nannotation, what is the most effective method for efficiently creating\nhigh-quality entity recognizers in under-resourced languages? Based on\nextensive experimentation using both simulated and real human annotation, we\nfind a dual-strategy approach best, starting with a cross-lingual transferred\nmodel, then performing targeted annotation of only uncertain entity spans in\nthe target language, minimizing annotator effort.

We address this question by mathematically analyzing\nthe nonlinear dynamics of learning in deep linear networks. We find exact\nsolutions to this learning dynamics that yield a conceptual explanation for the\nprevalence of many disparate phenomena in semantic cognition, including the\nhierarchical differentiation of concepts through rapid developmental\ntransitions, the ubiquity of semantic illusions between such transitions, the\nemergence of item typicality and category coherence as factors controlling the\nspeed of semantic processing, changing patterns of inductive projection over\ndevelopment, and the conservation of semantic similarity in neural\nrepresentations across species.

In our formalization,\nmaking sense involves constructing a symbolic causal theory that both explains\nthe sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of unity conditions. The unity\nconditions insist that the constituents of the causal theory -- objects,\nproperties, and laws -- must be integrated into a coherent whole. On our\naccount, making sense of sensory input is a type of program synthesis, but it\nis unsupervised program synthesis.\nOur second contribution is a computer implementation, the Apperception\nEngine, that was designed to satisfy the above requirements. Our system is able\nto produce interpretable human-readable causal theories from very small amounts\nof data, because of the strong inductive bias provided by the unity conditions.\nA causal theory produced by our system is able to predict future sensor\nreadings, as well as retrodict earlier readings, and impute (fill in the blanks\nof) missing sensory readings, in any combination.\nWe tested the engine in a diverse variety of domains, including cellular\nautomata, rhythms and simple nursery tunes, multi-modal binding problems,\nocclusion tasks, and sequence induction intelligence tests. In each domain, we\ntest our engine's ability to predict future sensor values, retrodict earlier\nsensor values, and impute missing sensory data.

There are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for\nhandling long documents, beyond the typical sentence-by-sentence processing\napproaches used in NLP, and techniques for addressing the tradeoff between\neffectiveness (result quality) and efficiency (query latency). Although\ntransformer architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations,\nmany aspects of how they are applied to text ranking are relatively well\nunderstood and represent mature techniques.

Using this representation we can calculate the optimal\ninformation theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization\nbounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is\nquantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity.\nWe argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and\nfeatures/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of\nthe information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input\nlayer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the\nlayered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along\nthe information curve.

Pre-trained language models trained to extract\ncontextual features from text were shown to improve many natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks, including scarcely labeled tasks, by leveraging\ntransfer learning.

This is a case of excessive\ndata leakage---a model is trained using features that otherwise would not be\navailable when the model needs to be applied for real prediction.

Link prediction on\nthe aforementioned relations is easy and can be achieved with even better\naccuracy using straightforward rules instead of sophisticated embedding models.\nA more fundamental defect of these models is that the link prediction scenario,\ngiven such data, is non-existent in the real-world.

Applying this augmentation to a strong Wikitext-103\nLM, with neighbors drawn from the original training set, our $k$NN-LM achieves\na new state-of-the-art perplexity of 15.79 - a 2.9 point improvement with no\nadditional training.

Qualitatively, the model is particularly helpful in\npredicting rare patterns, such as factual knowledge.

Existing approaches, such as\nuncertainty sampling or information density, search globally for the optimal\nexamples to label, scaling linearly or even quadratically with the unlabeled\ndata. However, in practice, data is often heavily skewed; only a small fraction\nof collected data will be relevant for a given learning task. For example, when\nidentifying rare classes, detecting malicious content, or debugging model\nperformance, the ratio of positive to negative examples can be 1 to 1,000 or\nmore. In this work, we exploit this skew in large training datasets to reduce\nthe number of unlabeled examples considered in each selection round by only\nlooking at the nearest neighbors to the labeled examples. Empirically, we\nobserve that learned representations effectively cluster unseen concepts,\nmaking active learning very effective and substantially reducing the number of\nviable unlabeled examples. We evaluate several active learning and search\ntechniques in this setting on three large-scale datasets: ImageNet, Goodreads\nspoiler detection, and OpenImages. For rare classes, active learning methods\nneed as little as 0.31% of the labeled data to match the average precision of\nfull supervision. By limiting active learning methods to only consider the\nimmediate neighbors of the labeled data as candidates for labeling, we need\nonly process as little as 1% of the unlabeled data while achieving similar\nreductions in labeling costs as the traditional global approach. This process\nof expanding the candidate pool with the nearest neighbors of the labeled set\ncan be done efficiently and reduces the computational complexity of selection\nby orders of magnitude.",

However, due to increased\ntest-time cost (for ensembles) and increased complexity of the training\npipeline (for distillation), these techniques are challenging to use in\nindustrial settings. In this paper we explore a variant of distillation which\nis relatively straightforward to use as it does not require a complicated\nmulti-stage setup or many new hyperparameters. Our first claim is that online\ndistillation enables us to use extra parallelism to fit very large datasets\nabout twice as fast. Crucially, we can still speed up training even after we\nhave already reached the point at which additional parallelism provides no\nbenefit for synchronous or asynchronous stochastic gradient descent. Two neural\nnetworks trained on disjoint subsets of the data can share knowledge by\nencouraging each model to agree with the predictions the other model would have\nmade. These predictions can come from a stale version of the other model so\nthey can be safely computed using weights that only rarely get transmitted. Our\nsecond claim is that online distillation is a cost-effective way to make the\nexact predictions of a model dramatically more reproducible.

This paper proposes\nColBERTer, a neural retrieval model using contextualized late interaction\n(ColBERT) with enhanced reduction. Along the effectiveness Pareto frontier,\nColBERTer's reductions dramatically lower ColBERT's storage requirements while\nsimultaneously improving the interpretability of its token-matching scores. To\nthis end, ColBERTer fuses single-vector retrieval, multi-vector refinement, and\noptional lexical matching components into one model. For its multi-vector\ncomponent, ColBERTer reduces the number of stored vectors per document by\nlearning unique whole-word representations for the terms in each document and\nlearning to identify and remove word representations that are not essential to\neffective scoring. We employ an explicit multi-task, multi-stage training to\nfacilitate using very small vector dimensions. Results on the MS MARCO and\nTREC-DL collection show that ColBERTer can reduce the storage footprint by up\nto 2.5x, while maintaining effectiveness. With just one dimension per token in\nits smallest setting, ColBERTer achieves index storage parity with the\nplaintext size, with very strong effectiveness results. Finally, we demonstrate\nColBERTer's robustness on seven high-quality out-of-domain collections,\nyielding statistically significant gains over traditional retrieval baselines.",

To\ntackle the problem, we propose a unified pre-training framework, namely,\nE-BERT.

The success of such a task\nheavily relies on the ability of modeling and inferring the patterns of (or\nbetween) the relations. In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge\ngraph embedding called RotatE, which is able to model and infer various\nrelation patterns including: symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition.\nSpecifically, the RotatE model defines each relation as a rotation from the\nsource entity to the target entity in the complex vector space. In addition, we\npropose a novel self-adversarial negative sampling technique for efficiently\nand effectively training the RotatE model. Experimental results on multiple\nbenchmark knowledge graphs show that the proposed RotatE model is not only\nscalable, but also able to infer and model various relation patterns and\nsignificantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.",

(2) The second uses the transformer\nonly to provide features to a standard LSTM-CRF sequence labeling architecture\nand thus performs no fine-tuning. In this paper, we perform a comparative\nanalysis of both approaches in a variety of settings currently considered in\nthe literature. In particular, we evaluate how well they work when\ndocument-level features are leveraged. Our evaluation on the classic CoNLL\nbenchmark datasets for 4 languages shows that document-level features\nsignificantly improve NER quality and that fine-tuning generally outperforms\nthe feature-based approaches.

For example, as you go from bottom to top layers, information about\nthe past in left-to-right language models gets vanished and predictions about\nthe future get formed.

We find that only SERAC achieves high performance on all three\nproblems, consistently outperforming existing approaches to model editing by a\nsignificant margin.

Traditionally, for\nthis problem supervision is expressed in the form of sets of points that follow\nan ordinal relationship -- an anchor point $x$ is similar to a set of positive\npoints $Y$, and dissimilar to a set of negative points $Z$, and a loss defined\nover these distances is minimized. While the specifics of the optimization\ndiffer, in this work we collectively call this type of supervision Triplets and\nall methods that follow this pattern Triplet-Based methods. These methods are\nchallenging to optimize. A main issue is the need for finding informative\ntriplets, which is usually achieved by a variety of tricks such as increasing\nthe batch size, hard or semi-hard triplet mining, etc. Even with these tricks,\nthe convergence rate of such methods is slow. In this paper we propose to\noptimize the triplet loss on a different space of triplets, consisting of an\nanchor data point and similar and dissimilar proxy points which are learned as\nwell. These proxies approximate the original data points, so that a triplet\nloss over the proxies is a tight upper bound of the original loss. This\nproxy-based loss is empirically better behaved. As a result, the proxy-loss\nimproves on state-of-art results for three standard zero-shot learning\ndatasets, by up to 15% points, while converging three times as fast as other\ntriplet-based losses.",

This paper describes a\nBayesian encoding technique developed for WeWork's lead scoring engine which\noutputs the probability of a person touring one of our office spaces based on\ninteraction, enrichment, and geospatial data. We present a paradigm for\nensemble modeling which mitigates the need to build complicated preprocessing\nand encoding schemes for categorical variables. In particular, domain-specific\nconjugate Bayesian models are employed as base learners for features in a\nstacked ensemble model. For each column of a categorical feature matrix we fit\na problem-specific prior distribution, for example, the Beta distribution for a\nbinary classification problem. In order to analytically derive the moments of\nthe posterior distribution, we update the prior with the conjugate likelihood\nof the corresponding target variable for each unique value of the given\ncategorical feature. This function of column and value encodes the categorical\nfeature matrix so that the final learner in the ensemble model ingests\nlow-dimensional numerical input. Experimental results on both curated and real\nworld datasets demonstrate impressive accuracy and computational efficiency on\na variety of problem archetypes.

Here we explore whether transformers can similarly learn to reason\n(or emulate reasoning), but using rules expressed in language, thus bypassing a\nformal representation. We provide the first demonstration that this is\npossible, and characterize the extent of this capability. To do this, we use a\ncollection of synthetic datasets that test increasing levels of reasoning\ncomplexity (number of rules, presence of negation, and depth of chaining). We\nfind transformers appear to learn rule-based reasoning with high (99%) accuracy\non these datasets, and in a way that generalizes to test data requiring\nsubstantially deeper chaining than in the training data (95%+ scores). We also\ndemonstrate that the models transfer well to two hand-authored rulebases, and\nto rulebases paraphrased into more natural language. These findings are\nsignificant as it suggests a new role for transformers, namely as a limited\n\"soft theorem prover\" operating over explicit theories in language. This in\nturn suggests new possibilities for explainability, correctability, and\ncounterfactual reasoning in question-answering.

Recently, promising results have been achieved by\nleveraging cross-modal information in KGs, using ensembles that combine\nknowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and contextual language models (LMs).\nHowever, existing ensembles are either (1) not consistently effective in terms\nof ranking accuracy gains or (2) impractically inefficient on larger datasets\ndue to the combinatorial explosion problem of pairwise ranking with deep\nlanguage models. In this paper, we propose a novel tiered ranking architecture\nCascadER to maintain the ranking accuracy of full ensembling while improving\nefficiency considerably. CascadER uses LMs to rerank the outputs of more\nefficient base KGEs, relying on an adaptive subset selection scheme aimed at\ninvoking the LMs minimally while maximizing accuracy gain over the KGE.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CascadER improves MRR by up to 9 points\nover KGE baselines, setting new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks\nwhile improving efficiency by one or more orders of magnitude over competitive\ncross-modal baselines.

In particular, by requiring the model to\npredict the language-specific token, the MLM objective disincentivizes learning\na language-agnostic representation -- which is a key goal of multilingual\npre-training. Therefore to encourage better cross-lingual representation\nlearning we propose the DICT-MLM method. DICT-MLM works by incentivizing the\nmodel to be able to predict not just the original masked word, but potentially\nany of its cross-lingual synonyms as well. Our empirical analysis on multiple\ndownstream tasks spanning 30+ languages, demonstrates the efficacy of the\nproposed approach and its ability to learn better multilingual representations.",

Although standard deep learning systems\nachieve state of the art results on static benchmarks, they often struggle in\ndynamic scenarios. In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can\ninterfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired\narchitectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the\nbiophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable\nnetworks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific\nmanner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel\nartificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and\nsparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we\nstudy the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring\ntask-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning\nenvironment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation\ntasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model's\nprediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks\ndemonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks,\nallowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting.\nOur neural implementation marks the first time a single architecture has\nachieved competitive results on both multi-task and continual learning\nsettings.

In light of the success of these broad-coverage\nmodels, we investigate whether it is still helpful to tailor a pretrained model\nto the domain of a target task. We present a study across four domains\n(biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews) and eight\nclassification tasks, showing that a second phase of pretraining in-domain\n(domain-adaptive pretraining) leads to performance gains, under both high- and\nlow-resource settings. Moreover, adapting to the task's unlabeled data\n(task-adaptive pretraining) improves performance even after domain-adaptive\npretraining. Finally, we show that adapting to a task corpus augmented using\nsimple data selection strategies is an effective alternative, especially when\nresources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be unavailable. Overall, we\nconsistently find that multi-phase adaptive pretraining offers large gains in\ntask performance.",

Besides, none of\nthe existing methods is capable of inferring all the relation patterns of\nsymmetry, inversion and composition as well as the complex properties of 1-N,\nN-1 and N-N relations, simultaneously.

Previous\nmethods allow a single static embedding for each entity or relation, ignoring\ntheir intrinsic contextual nature, i.e., entities and relations may appear in\ndifferent graph contexts, and accordingly, exhibit different properties. This\nwork presents Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding (CoKE), a novel paradigm\nthat takes into account such contextual nature, and learns dynamic, flexible,\nand fully contextualized entity and relation embeddings. Two types of graph\ncontexts are studied: edges and paths, both formulated as sequences of entities\nand relations. CoKE takes a sequence as input and uses a Transformer encoder to\nobtain contextualized representations. These representations are hence\nnaturally adaptive to the input, capturing contextual meanings of entities and\nrelations therein. Evaluation on a wide variety of public benchmarks verifies\nthe superiority of CoKE in link prediction and path query answering. It\nperforms consistently better than, or at least equally well as current\nstate-of-the-art in almost every case, in particular offering an absolute\nimprovement of 21.0% in H@10 on path query answering.

Instead, weaker forms of supervision that provide noisier but cheaper\nlabels are often used. However, these weak supervision sources have diverse and\nunknown accuracies, may output correlated labels, and may label different tasks\nor apply at different levels of granularity. We propose a framework for\nintegrating and modeling such weak supervision sources by viewing them as\nlabeling different related sub-tasks of a problem, which we refer to as the\nmulti-task weak supervision setting. We show that by solving a matrix\ncompletion-style problem, we can recover the accuracies of these multi-task\nsources given their dependency structure, but without any labeled data, leading\nto higher-quality supervision for training an end model. Theoretically, we show\nthat the generalization error of models trained with this approach improves\nwith the number of unlabeled data points, and characterize the scaling with\nrespect to the task and dependency structures. On three fine-grained\nclassification problems, we show that our approach leads to average gains of\n20.2 points in accuracy over a traditional supervised approach, 6.8 points over\na majority vote baseline, and 4.1 points over a previously proposed weak\nsupervision method that models tasks separately.",

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole\nensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to\nallow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual\nmodels are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it\nis possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which\nis much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different\ncompression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show\nthat we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used\ncommercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a\nsingle model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more\nfull models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained\nclasses that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these\nspecialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.",

We\nfirst show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice\nand true/false questions when they are provided in the right format. Thus we\ncan approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to\nfirst propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability \"P(True)\" that\ntheir answers are correct. We find encouraging performance, calibration, and\nscaling for P(True) on a diverse array of tasks. Performance at self-evaluation\nfurther improves when we allow models to consider many of their own samples\nbefore predicting the validity of one specific possibility. Next, we\ninvestigate whether models can be trained to predict \"P(IK)\", the probability\nthat \"I know\" the answer to a question, without reference to any particular\nproposed answer. Models perform well at predicting P(IK) and partially\ngeneralize across tasks, though they struggle with calibration of P(IK) on new\ntasks. The predicted P(IK) probabilities also increase appropriately in the\npresence of relevant source materials in the context, and in the presence of\nhints towards the solution of mathematical word problems.

Graph representation learning methods have generally\nfallen into three main categories, based on the availability of labeled data.\nThe first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph\nauto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational\nstructure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to\naugment neural network losses with a regularization objective for\nsemi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn\ndifferentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure.\nHowever, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly\nlittle work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap\nbetween graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization\nmodels. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods\nfor graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work.\nSpecifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model (GRAPHEDM), which\ngeneralizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g.\nGraphSage, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and\nunsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. DeepWalk, node2vec, etc)\ninto a single consistent approach.

This limits the usage of dense retrieval\napproaches to only a few domains with large training datasets.\nIn this paper, we propose the novel unsupervised domain adaptation method\nGenerative Pseudo Labeling (GPL), which combines a query generator with pseudo\nlabeling from a cross-encoder. On six representative domain-specialized\ndatasets, we find the proposed GPL can outperform an out-of-the-box\nstate-of-the-art dense retrieval approach by up to 8.9 points nDCG@10.

The latency of\nneural ranking models at query time is largely dependent on the architecture\nand deliberate choices by their designers to trade-off effectiveness for higher\nefficiency. This focus on low query latency of a rising number of efficient\nranking architectures make them feasible for production deployment. In machine\nlearning an increasingly common approach to close the effectiveness gap of more\nefficient models is to apply knowledge distillation from a large teacher model\nto a smaller student model. We find that different ranking architectures tend\nto produce output scores in different magnitudes. Based on this finding, we\npropose a cross-architecture training procedure with a margin focused loss\n(Margin-MSE), that adapts knowledge distillation to the varying score output\ndistributions of different BERT and non-BERT passage ranking architectures. We\napply the teachable information as additional fine-grained labels to existing\ntraining triples of the MSMARCO-Passage collection. We evaluate our procedure\nof distilling knowledge from state-of-the-art concatenated BERT models to four\ndifferent efficient architectures (TK, ColBERT, PreTT, and a BERT CLS dot\nproduct model).

Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised,\ngraph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse,\nrepresentative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets\n(covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code\ngeneration) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task\nperformance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4%\nrelative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly\nselecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised\nfinetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less\nannotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our\nframework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative\nselective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain\nshift. We hope that our studies will serve as a basis for data annotations as\nlarge language models are increasingly applied to new tasks.

In this paper, we propose a new direction\ntoward this goal by introducing a differentiable (smoothed) maximum\nsatisfiability (MAXSAT) solver that can be integrated into the loop of larger\ndeep learning systems. Our (approximate) solver is based upon a fast coordinate\ndescent approach to solving the semidefinite program (SDP) associated with the\nMAXSAT problem. We show how to analytically differentiate through the solution\nto this SDP and efficiently solve the associated backward pass. We demonstrate\nthat by integrating this solver into end-to-end learning systems, we can learn\nthe logical structure of challenging problems in a minimally supervised\nfashion. In particular, we show that we can learn the parity function using\nsingle-bit supervision (a traditionally hard task for deep networks) and learn\nhow to play 9x9 Sudoku solely from examples.

Despite its simplicity, this approach achieves superior or\ncomparable performance on both topic and sentiment classification datasets and\noutperforms prior works significantly on unbalanced datasets. We further\nexplore the applicability of our clustering approach by evaluating it on 14\ndatasets with more diverse topics, text lengths, and numbers of classes.

Several\napproaches using embeddings have shown promising results on tasks such as link\nprediction, entity recommendation, question answering, and triplet\nclassification. However, only a few methods can compute low-dimensional\nembeddings of very large knowledge bases without needing state-of-the-art\ncomputational resources. In this paper, we propose KG2Vec, a simple and fast\napproach to Knowledge Graph Embedding based on the skip-gram model. Instead of\nusing a predefined scoring function, we learn it relying on Long Short-Term\nMemories. We show that our embeddings achieve results comparable with the most\nscalable approaches on knowledge graph completion as well as on a new metric.\nYet, KG2Vec can embed large graphs in lesser time by processing more than 250\nmillion triples in less than 7 hours on common hardware.",

        "summary": "Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and\ntransfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred\nto as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms\nthat together contribute to the development and specialization of our\nsensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval.\nConsequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for autonomous agents\ninteracting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information.\nHowever, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine\nlearning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of\nincrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions\ngenerally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation\nrepresents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models\nthat typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data,\nthus without accounting for situations in which information becomes\nincrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the\nmain challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and\ncompare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different\nextents, catastrophic forgetting. We discuss well-established and emerging\nresearch motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as\nstructural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning,\nintrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.",

        "summary": "When transferring a pretrained model to a downstream task, two popular\nmethods are full fine-tuning (updating all the model parameters) and linear\nprobing (updating only the last linear layer -- the \"head\"). It is well known\nthat fine-tuning leads to better accuracy in-distribution (ID). However, in\nthis paper, we find that fine-tuning can achieve worse accuracy than linear\nprobing out-of-distribution (OOD) when the pretrained features are good and the\ndistribution shift is large. On 10 distribution shift datasets\n(Breeds-Living17, Breeds-Entity30, DomainNet, CIFAR $\\to$ STL, CIFAR10.1, FMoW,\nImageNetV2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-Sketch), fine-tuning obtains on\naverage 2% higher accuracy ID but 7% lower accuracy OOD than linear probing. We\nshow theoretically that this tradeoff between ID and OOD accuracy arises even\nin a simple setting: fine-tuning overparameterized two-layer linear networks.\nWe prove that the OOD error of fine-tuning is high when we initialize with a\nfixed or random head -- this is because while fine-tuning learns the head, the\nlower layers of the neural network change simultaneously and distort the\npretrained features. Our analysis suggests that the easy two-step strategy of\nlinear probing then full fine-tuning (LP-FT), sometimes used as a fine-tuning\nheuristic, combines the benefits of both fine-tuning and linear probing.\nEmpirically, LP-FT outperforms both fine-tuning and linear probing on the above\ndatasets (1% better ID, 10% better OOD than full fine-tuning).",

For example, online retailers (e.g.,\nAmazon and eBay) use taxonomies for product recommendation, and web search\nengines (e.g., Google and Bing) leverage taxonomies to enhance query\nunderstanding. Enormous efforts have been made on constructing taxonomies\neither manually or semi-automatically. However, with the fast-growing volume of\nweb content, existing taxonomies will become outdated and fail to capture\nemerging knowledge. Therefore, in many applications, dynamic expansions of an\nexisting taxonomy are in great demand. In this paper, we study how to expand an\nexisting taxonomy by adding a set of new concepts. We propose a novel\nself-supervised framework, named TaxoExpan, which automatically generates a set\nof <query concept, anchor concept> pairs from the existing taxonomy as training\ndata. Using such self-supervision data, TaxoExpan learns a model to predict\nwhether a query concept is the direct hyponym of an anchor concept. We develop\ntwo innovative techniques in TaxoExpan: (1) a position-enhanced graph neural\nnetwork that encodes the local structure of an anchor concept in the existing\ntaxonomy, and (2) a noise-robust training objective that enables the learned\nmodel to be insensitive to the label noise in the self-supervision data.\nExtensive experiments on three large-scale datasets from different domains\ndemonstrate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of TaxoExpan for taxonomy\nexpansion.",

Among them, dense phrase retrieval-the most\nfine-grained retrieval unit-is appealing because phrases can be directly used\nas the output for question answering and slot filling tasks. In this work, we\nfollow the intuition that retrieving phrases naturally entails retrieving\nlarger text blocks and study whether phrase retrieval can serve as the basis\nfor coarse-level retrieval including passages and documents. We first observe\nthat a dense phrase-retrieval system, without any retraining, already achieves\nbetter passage retrieval accuracy (+3-5% in top-5 accuracy) compared to passage\nretrievers, which also helps achieve superior end-to-end QA performance with\nfewer passages. Then, we provide an interpretation for why phrase-level\nsupervision helps learn better fine-grained entailment compared to\npassage-level supervision, and also show that phrase retrieval can be improved\nto achieve competitive performance in document-retrieval tasks such as entity\nlinking and knowledge-grounded dialogue. Finally, we demonstrate how phrase\nfiltering and vector quantization can reduce the size of our index by 4-10x,\nmaking dense phrase retrieval a practical and versatile solution in\nmulti-granularity retrieval.",

We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to\nimprove the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast\nspace of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata)\nthat are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage\nand feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question\nanswering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second,\nwe adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration,\nrobustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core\nscenarios when possible (87.5% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond\naccuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We\nalso perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze\nspecific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a\nlarge-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open,\nlimited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not\npreviously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average\nwere evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent\nmodels not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now\nall 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and\nmetrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level\nfindings.

        "summary": "In-context learning refers to the ability of a model to condition on a prompt\nsequence consisting of in-context examples (input-output pairs corresponding to\nsome task) along with a new query input, and generate the corresponding output.\nCrucially, in-context learning happens only at inference time without any\nparameter updates to the model. While large language models such as GPT-3\nexhibit some ability to perform in-context learning, it is unclear what the\nrelationship is between tasks on which this succeeds and what is present in the\ntraining data. To make progress towards understanding in-context learning, we\nconsider the well-defined problem of training a model to in-context learn a\nfunction class (e.g., linear functions): that is, given data derived from some\nfunctions in the class, can we train a model to in-context learn \"most\"\nfunctions from this class? We show empirically that standard Transformers can\nbe trained from scratch to perform in-context learning of linear functions --\nthat is, the trained model is able to learn unseen linear functions from\nin-context examples with performance comparable to the optimal least squares\nestimator. In fact, in-context learning is possible even under two forms of\ndistribution shift: (i) between the training data of the model and\ninference-time prompts, and (ii) between the in-context examples and the query\ninput during inference. We also show that we can train Transformers to\nin-context learn more complex function classes -- namely sparse linear\nfunctions, two-layer neural networks, and decision trees -- with performance\nthat matches or exceeds task-specific learning algorithms.

One way to understand current approaches is as\nclassifiers among atomic labels, one for each entity.

We propose GENRE, the first system that retrieves entities by\ngenerating their unique names, left to right, token-by-token in an\nautoregressive fashion, and conditioned on the context. This enables to\nmitigate the aforementioned technical issues: i) the autoregressive formulation\nallows us to directly capture relations between context and entity name,\neffectively cross encoding both; ii) the memory footprint is greatly reduced\nbecause the parameters of our encoder-decoder architecture scale with\nvocabulary size, not entity count; iii) the exact softmax loss can be\nefficiently computed without the need to subsample negative data.

We show that models trained using hash embeddings\nexhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular\nembeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the number of parameters\nneeded by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular\nembedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the\nhashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding, hash\nembeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing\nregular embedding types.",

While\ntraditional methods were based on hand-crafted features, continuous\nrepresentations based on neural networks recently obtained competitive results.\nA challenge of using such methods is to obtain supervised data to train the\nretriever model, corresponding to pairs of query and support documents. In this\npaper, we propose a technique to learn retriever models for downstream tasks,\ninspired by knowledge distillation, and which does not require annotated pairs\nof query and documents.

Datasets in extreme\nclassification exhibit fit to power-law distribution, i.e. a large fraction of\nlabels have very few positive instances in the data distribution. Most\nstate-of-the-art approaches for extreme multi-label classification attempt to\ncapture correlation among labels by embedding the label matrix to a\nlow-dimensional linear sub-space. However, in the presence of power-law\ndistributed extremely large and diverse label spaces, structural assumptions\nsuch as low rank can be easily violated.\nIn this work, we present DiSMEC, which is a large-scale distributed framework\nfor learning one-versus-rest linear classifiers coupled with explicit capacity\ncontrol to control model size. Unlike most state-of-the-art methods, DiSMEC\ndoes not make any low rank assumptions on the label matrix. Using double layer\nof parallelization, DiSMEC can learn classifiers for datasets consisting\nhundreds of thousands labels within few hours. The explicit capacity control\nmechanism filters out spurious parameters which keep the model compact in size,\nwithout losing prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation\non publicly available real-world datasets consisting upto 670,000 labels. We\ncompare DiSMEC with recent state-of-the-art approaches, including - SLEEC which\nis a leading approach for learning sparse local embeddings, and FastXML which\nis a tree-based approach optimizing ranking based loss function.

In this\npaper, we rigorously compare few-shot ICL and PEFT and demonstrate that the\nlatter offers better accuracy as well as dramatically lower computational\ncosts. Along the way, we introduce a new PEFT method called (IA)$^3$ that\nscales activations by learned vectors, attaining stronger performance while\nonly introducing a relatively tiny amount of new parameters. We also propose a\nsimple recipe based on the T0 model called T-Few that can be applied to new\ntasks without task-specific tuning or modifications.

To test this question at scale, we develop a system for easily\nmapping general natural language tasks into a human-readable prompted form.

Currently, representation learning mostly relies on embedding\ndata into Euclidean space. However, recent work has shown that data in some\ndomains is better modeled by non-euclidean metric spaces, and inappropriate\ngeometry can result in inferior performance. In this paper, we aim to eliminate\nthe inductive bias imposed by the embedding space geometry. Namely, we propose\nto map data into more general non-vector metric spaces: a weighted graph with a\nshortest path distance. By design, such graphs can model arbitrary geometry\nwith a proper configuration of edges and weights. Our main contribution is\nPRODIGE: a method that learns a weighted graph representation of data\nend-to-end by gradient descent. Greater generality and fewer model assumptions\nmake PRODIGE more powerful than existing embedding-based approaches.

The first\nstage does retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that\nindependently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions. Each\ncandidate is then re-ranked with a cross-encoder, that concatenates the mention\nand entity text. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is state of the art\non recent zero-shot benchmarks (6 point absolute gains) and also on more\nestablished non-zero-shot evaluations (e.g. TACKBP-2010), despite its relative\nsimplicity (e.g. no explicit entity embeddings or manually engineered mention\ntables). We also show that bi-encoder linking is very fast with nearest\nneighbour search (e.g. linking with 5.9 million candidates in 2 milliseconds),\nand that much of the accuracy gain from the more expensive cross-encoder can be\ntransferred to the bi-encoder via knowledge distillation.

The last few decades of work\nin this area have led to significant progress in the accuracy of classifiers,\nwith the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While\nextremely accurate, HIVE-COTE is infeasible to use in many applications because\nof its very high training time complexity in O(N^2*T^4) for a dataset with N\ntime series of length T. For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 72,000s to\nlearn from a small dataset with N=700 time series of short length T=46. Deep\nlearning, on the other hand, has now received enormous attention because of its\nhigh scalability and state-of-the-art accuracy in computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing tasks. Deep learning for TSC has only very recently started\nto be explored, with the first few architectures developed over the last 3\nyears only. The accuracy of deep learning for TSC has been raised to a\ncompetitive level, but has not quite reached the level of HIVE-COTE. This is\nwhat this paper achieves: outperforming HIVE-COTE's accuracy together with\nscalability. We take an important step towards finding the AlexNet network for\nTSC by presenting InceptionTime---an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our\nexperiments show that InceptionTime slightly outperforms HIVE-COTE with a\nwin/draw/loss on the UCR archive of 40/6/39.

We study whether assertions enable a system to emulate\nrepresentations preserving semantic relations like equivalence. We find that\nassertions enable semantic emulation if all expressions in the language are\nreferentially transparent.

We show that by explicitly representing this training\nset labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated\ntraining set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of\nthese generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a\ndiscriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method\nover a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs.\nExperimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data\nprogramming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying\ndata programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points\nover a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the\ncompetition).

        "summary": "Recently, there is an effort to extend fine-grained entity typing by using a\nricher and ultra-fine set of types, and labeling noun phrases including\npronouns and nominal nouns instead of just named entity mentions. A key\nchallenge for this ultra-fine entity typing task is that human annotated data\nare extremely scarce, and the annotation ability of existing distant or weak\nsupervision approaches is very limited. To remedy this problem, in this paper,\nwe propose to obtain training data for ultra-fine entity typing by using a BERT\nMasked Language Model (MLM). Given a mention in a sentence, our approach\nconstructs an input for the BERT MLM so that it predicts context dependent\nhypernyms of the mention, which can be used as type labels. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that, with the help of these automatically generated\nlabels, the performance of an ultra-fine entity typing model can be improved\nsubstantially. We also show that our approach can be applied to improve\ntraditional fine-grained entity typing after performing simple type mapping.",

In recent years, due to\nthe rapid development of internet technology, we are in an era of information\ntorrents and we have massive amounts of data. In this way, DL has aroused\nstrong interest of researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with\nDL, researchers have relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because\nbefore the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few\nlabeled samples. Therefore, early AL is difficult to reflect the value it\ndeserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this\nsuccess is due to the publicity of the large number of existing annotation\ndatasets.

Recently, Dasgupta reframed HC as a discrete\noptimization problem by introducing a global cost function measuring the\nquality of a given tree. In this work, we provide the first continuous\nrelaxation of Dasgupta's discrete optimization problem with provable quality\nguarantees. The key idea of our method, HypHC, is showing a direct\ncorrespondence from discrete trees to continuous representations (via the\nhyperbolic embeddings of their leaf nodes) and back (via a decoding algorithm\nthat maps leaf embeddings to a dendrogram), allowing us to search the space of\ndiscrete binary trees with continuous optimization. Building on analogies\nbetween trees and hyperbolic space, we derive a continuous analogue for the\nnotion of lowest common ancestor, which leads to a continuous relaxation of\nDasgupta's discrete objective. We can show that after decoding, the global\nminimizer of our continuous relaxation yields a discrete tree with a (1 +\nepsilon)-factor approximation for Dasgupta's optimal tree, where epsilon can be\nmade arbitrarily small and controls optimization challenges. We experimentally\nevaluate HypHC on a variety of HC benchmarks and find that even approximate\nsolutions found with gradient descent have superior clustering quality than\nagglomerative heuristics or other gradient based algorithms.

Such decision support systems can be found in critical domains, such as\nlegislation, law enforcement, etc. It is important that the humans making\nhigh-level decisions can be sure that the DNN decisions are driven by\ncombinations of data features that are appropriate in the context of the\ndeployment of the decision support system and that the decisions made are\nlegally or ethically defensible. Due to the incredible pace at which DNN\ntechnology is being developed, the development of new methods and studies on\nexplaining the decision-making process of DNNs has blossomed into an active\nresearch field. A practitioner beginning to study explainable deep learning may\nbe intimidated by the plethora of orthogonal directions the field is taking.\nThis complexity is further exacerbated by the general confusion that exists in\ndefining what it means to be able to explain the actions of a deep learning\nsystem and to evaluate a system's \"ability to explain\". To alleviate this\nproblem, this article offers a \"field guide\" to deep learning explainability\nfor those uninitiated in the field. The field guide: i) Discusses the traits of\na deep learning system that researchers enhance in explainability research, ii)\nplaces explainability in the context of other related deep learning research\nareas, and iii) introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of\nfoundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning. The guide is\ndesigned as an easy-to-digest starting point for those just embarking in the\nfield.",

        "summary": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are of great importance to many real world\napplications, but they generally suffer from incomplete information in the form\nof missing relations between entities. Knowledge graph completion (also known\nas relation prediction) is the task of inferring missing facts given existing\nones. Most of the existing work is proposed by maximizing the likelihood of\nobserved instance-level triples. Not much attention, however, is paid to the\nontological information, such as type information of entities and relations. In\nthis work, we propose a type-augmented relation prediction (TaRP) method, where\nwe apply both the type information and instance-level information for relation\nprediction. In particular, type information and instance-level information are\nencoded as prior probabilities and likelihoods of relations respectively, and\nare combined by following Bayes' rule. Our proposed TaRP method achieves\nsignificantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods on three\nbenchmark datasets: FB15K, YAGO26K-906, and DB111K-174. In addition, we show\nthat TaRP achieves significantly improved data efficiency. More importantly,\nthe type information extracted from a specific dataset can generalize well to\nother datasets through the proposed TaRP model.",

Dense\nretrieval is a central challenge for open-domain tasks, such as Open QA, where\nstate-of-the-art methods typically require large supervised datasets with\ncustom hard-negative mining and denoising of positive examples. ART, in\ncontrast, only requires access to unpaired inputs and outputs (e.g. questions\nand potential answer documents). It uses a new document-retrieval autoencoding\nscheme, where (1) an input question is used to retrieve a set of evidence\ndocuments, and (2) the documents are then used to compute the probability of\nreconstructing the original question. Training for retrieval based on question\nreconstruction enables effective unsupervised learning of both document and\nquestion encoders, which can be later incorporated into complete Open QA\nsystems without any further finetuning.

This is intrinsically difficult because the query and\nthe document may use different vocabulary, or the document may contain query\nwords without being relevant. We investigate neural word embeddings as a source\nof evidence in document ranking. We train a word2vec embedding model on a large\nunlabelled query corpus, but in contrast to how the model is commonly used, we\nretain both the input and the output projections, allowing us to leverage both\nthe embedding spaces to derive richer distributional relationships. During\nranking we map the query words into the input space and the document words into\nthe output space, and compute a query-document relevance score by aggregating\nthe cosine similarities across all the query-document word pairs.\nWe postulate that the proposed Dual Embedding Space Model (DESM) captures\nevidence on whether a document is about a query term in addition to what is\nmodelled by traditional term-frequency based approaches. Our experiments show\nthat the DESM can re-rank top documents returned by a commercial Web search\nengine, like Bing, better than a term-matching based signal like TF-IDF.\nHowever, when ranking a larger set of candidate documents, we find the\nembeddings-based approach is prone to false positives, retrieving documents\nthat are only loosely related to the query.

While remarkably effective, the\nranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of\nmagnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each\nquery-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single\nrelevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that\nadapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT\nintroduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query\nand the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction\nstep that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining\nthis fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep\nLMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document\nrepresentations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond\nreducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model,\nColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging\nvector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large\ndocument collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage\nsearch datasets.

Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper\nunderstanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful\napplications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction,\netc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and\nspace cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the\ngraph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional\nspace in which the graph structural information and graph properties are\nmaximally preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the\nliterature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of\ngraph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two\ntaxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in\ndifferent graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work address\nthese challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications\nthat graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research\ndirections in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques and\napplication scenarios.",

Catastrophic forgetting refers to the abrupt unlearning of a\nprevious task when a new task is learned. It is an emergent phenomenon that\nhinders continual learning. Existing universal function approximation theorems\nfor ANNs guarantee function approximation ability, but do not predict\ncatastrophic forgetting. This paper presents a novel universal approximation\ntheorem for multi-variable functions using only single-variable functions and\nexponential functions. Furthermore, we present ATLAS: a novel ANN architecture\nbased on the new theorem. It is shown that ATLAS is a universal function\napproximator capable of some memory retention, and continual learning. The\nmemory of ATLAS is imperfect, with some off-target effects during continual\nlearning, but it is well-behaved and predictable. An efficient implementation\nof ATLAS is provided.

However, if the top-k\noperation is implemented in an algorithmic way, e.g., using bubble algorithm,\nthe resulting model cannot be trained in an end-to-end way using prevalent\ngradient descent algorithms. This is because these implementations typically\ninvolve swapping indices, whose gradient cannot be computed. Moreover, the\ncorresponding mapping from the input scores to the indicator vector of whether\nthis element belongs to the top-k set is essentially discontinuous. To address\nthe issue, we propose a smoothed approximation, namely the SOFT (Scalable\nOptimal transport-based diFferenTiable) top-k operator. Specifically, our SOFT\ntop-k operator approximates the output of the top-k operation as the solution\nof an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem. The gradient of the SOFT\noperator can then be efficiently approximated based on the optimality\nconditions of EOT problem.

        "summary": "To provide more accurate, diverse, and explainable recommendation, it is\ncompulsory to go beyond modeling user-item interactions and take side\ninformation into account. Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM)\ncast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an\nindependent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the\nrelations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an\nactor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the\ncollaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we\ninvestigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the\nindependent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We\nargue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order\nrelations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes\n--- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new\nmethod named Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) which explicitly models\nthe high-order connectivities in KG in an end-to-end fashion. It recursively\npropagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors (which can be users, items,\nor attributes) to refine the node's embedding, and employs an attention\nmechanism to discriminate the importance of the neighbors. Our KGAT is\nconceptually advantageous to existing KG-based recommendation methods, which\neither exploit high-order relations by extracting paths or implicitly modeling\nthem with regularization. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show\nthat KGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Neural FM and\nRippleNet. Further studies verify the efficacy of embedding propagation for\nhigh-order relation modeling and the interpretability benefits brought by the\nattention mechanism.",

In the discrete version, our automatically\ncompressed tags form an alternative tag set: we show experimentally that our\ntags capture most of the information in traditional POS tag annotations, but\nour tag sequences can be parsed more accurately at the same level of tag\ngranularity. In the continuous version, we show experimentally that moderately\ncompressing the word embeddings by our method yields a more accurate parser in\n8 of 9 languages, unlike simple dimensionality reduction.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of the efficacy of knowledge\ndistillation and its dependence on student and teacher architectures. Starting\nwith the observation that more accurate teachers often don't make good\nteachers, we attempt to tease apart the factors that affect knowledge\ndistillation performance. We find crucially that larger models do not often\nmake better teachers. We show that this is a consequence of mismatched\ncapacity, and that small students are unable to mimic large teachers. We find\ntypical ways of circumventing this (such as performing a sequence of knowledge\ndistillation steps) to be ineffective. Finally, we show that this effect can be\nmitigated by stopping the teacher's training early. Our results generalize\nacross datasets and models.",

Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data mining tasks such as information retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative \ufb01ltering, and protein ranking in Bioinformatics.

Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximally preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work address these challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques and application scenarios.",

        "summary": "Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications, such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption planning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy, traffic, economics, weather and disease.

        "summary": "The wealth of structured (e.g. Wikidata) and unstructured data about the world available today presents an incredible opportunity for tomorrow's Artificial Intelligence. So far, integration of these two different modalities is a difficult process, involving many decisions concerning how best to represent the information so that it will be captured or useful, and hand-labeling large amounts of data. DeepType overcomes this challenge by explicitly integrating symbolic information into the reasoning process of a neural network with a type system. First we construct a type system, and second, we use it to constrain the outputs of a neural network to respect the symbolic structure. We achieve this by reformulating the design problem into a mixed integer problem: create a type system and subsequently train a neural network with it. In this reformulation discrete variables select which parent-child relations from an ontology are types within the type system, while continuous variables control a classifier fit to the type system. The original problem cannot be solved exactly, so we propose a 2-step algorithm: 1) heuristic search or stochastic optimization over discrete variables that define a type system informed by an Oracle and a Learnability heuristic, 2) gradient descent to fit classifier parameters. We apply DeepType to the problem of Entity Linking on three standard datasets (i.e. WikiDisamb30, CoNLL (YAGO), TAC KBP 2010) and find that it outperforms all existing solutions by a wide margin, including approaches that rely on a human-designed type system or recent deep learning-based entity embeddings, while explicitly using symbolic information lets it integrate new entities without retraining.",

However, multi-relational knowledge graphs often exhibit multiple simultaneous hierarchies, which current hyperbolic models do not capture. To address this, we propose a model that embeds multi-relational graph data in the Poincar\\'e ball model of hyperbolic space. Our Multi-Relational Poincar\\'e model (MuRP) learns relation-specific parameters to transform entity embeddings by M\\\"obius matrix-vector multiplication and M\\\"obius addition. Experiments on the hierarchical WN18RR knowledge graph show that our Poincar\\'e embeddings outperform their Euclidean counterpart and existing embedding methods on the link prediction task, particularly at lower dimensionality.",

In contrast, knowledge embedding (KE) methods can effectively represent the relational facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) with informative entity embeddings, but conventional KE models do not utilize the rich text data. In this paper, we propose a unified model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained LanguagE Representation (KEPLER), which can not only better integrate factual knowledge into PLMs but also effectively learn KE through the abundant information in text. In KEPLER, we encode textual descriptions of entities with a PLM as their embeddings, and then jointly optimize the KE and language modeling objectives. Experimental results show that KEPLER achieves state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks, and also works remarkably well as an inductive KE model on the link prediction task. Furthermore, for pre-training KEPLER and evaluating the KE performance, we construct Wikidata5M, a large-scale KG dataset with aligned entity descriptions, and benchmark state-of-the-art KE methods on it. It shall serve as a new KE benchmark and facilitate the research on large KG, inductive KE, and KG with text.

        "title": "Embedding Entities and Relations for Learning and Inference in Knowledge Bases",
        "summary": "We consider learning representations of entities and relations in KBs using the neural-embedding approach. We show that most existing models, including NTN (Socher et al., 2013) and TransE (Bordes et al., 2013b), can be generalized under a unified learning framework, where entities are low-dimensional vectors learned from a neural network and relations are bilinear and/or linear mapping functions. Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task. We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2% vs. 54.7% by TransE on Freebase). Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the learned relation embeddings to mine logical rules such as \"BornInCity(a,b) and CityInCountry(b,c) => Nationality(a,c)\". We find that embeddings learned from the bilinear objective are particularly good at capturing relational semantics and that the composition of relations is characterized by matrix multiplication. More interestingly, we demonstrate that our embedding-based rule extraction approach successfully outperforms a state-of-the-art confidence-based rule mining approach in mining Horn rules that involve compositional reasoning.",

        "summary": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have found many applications in industry and academic settings, which in turn, have motivated considerable research efforts towards large-scale information extraction from a variety of sources. Despite such efforts, it is well known that even state-of-the-art KGs suffer from incompleteness. Link Prediction (LP), the task of predicting missing facts among entities already a KG, is a promising and widely studied task aimed at addressing KG incompleteness. Among the recent LP techniques, those based on KG embeddings have achieved very promising performances in some benchmarks. Despite the fast growing literature in the subject, insufficient attention has been paid to the effect of the various design choices in those methods. Moreover, the standard practice in this area is to report accuracy by aggregating over a large number of test facts in which some entities are over-represented; this allows LP methods to exhibit good performance by just attending to structural properties that include such entities, while ignoring the remaining majority of the KG. This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of embedding-based LP methods, extending the dimensions of analysis beyond what is commonly available in the literature. We experimentally compare effectiveness and efficiency of 16 state-of-the-art methods, consider a rule-based baseline, and report detailed analysis over the most popular benchmarks in the literature.",

SetFit (Tunstall et al., 2022) is a recent, practical approach that fine-tunes a Sentence Transformer under a contrastive learning paradigm and achieves similar results to more unwieldy systems. Text classification is important for addressing the problem of domain drift in detecting harmful content, which plagues all social media platforms. Here, we propose Like a Good Nearest Neighbor (LaGoNN), an inexpensive modification to SetFit that requires no additional parameters or hyperparameters but modifies input with information about its nearest neighbor, for example, the label and text, in the training data, making novel data appear similar to an instance on which the model was optimized. LaGoNN is effective at the task of detecting harmful content and generally improves performance compared to SetFit. To demonstrate the value of our system, we conduct a thorough study of text classification systems in the context of content moderation under four label distributions.",

Analysis of this work suggests that these centroids are term-topic embeddings''. We examine whether term-topic embeddings can be created in a differentiable end-to-end way, finding that this is a viable strategy for removing the separate clustering step.

        "summary": "Multi-vector retrieval models such as ColBERT [Khattab and Zaharia, 2020] allow token-level interactions between queries and documents, and hence achieve state of the art on many information retrieval benchmarks. However, their non-linear scoring function cannot be scaled to millions of documents, necessitating a three-stage process for inference: retrieving initial candidates via token retrieval, accessing all token vectors, and scoring the initial candidate documents. The non-linear scoring function is applied over all token vectors of each candidate document, making the inference process complicated and slow. In this paper, we aim to simplify the multi-vector retrieval by rethinking the role of token retrieval. We present XTR, ConteXtualized Token Retriever, which introduces a simple, yet novel, objective function that encourages the model to retrieve the most important document tokens first. The improvement to token retrieval allows XTR to rank candidates only using the retrieved tokens rather than all tokens in the document, and enables a newly designed scoring stage that is two-to-three orders of magnitude cheaper than that of ColBERT. On the popular BEIR benchmark, XTR advances the state-of-the-art by 2.8 nDCG@10 without any distillation. Detailed analysis confirms our decision to revisit the token retrieval stage, as XTR demonstrates much better recall of the token retrieval stage compared to ColBERT.",

        "summary": "Document indexing is a key component for efficient information retrieval (IR). After preprocessing steps such as stemming and stop-word removal, document indexes usually store term-frequencies (tf). Along with tf (that only reflects the importance of a term in a document), traditional IR models use term discrimination values (TDVs) such as inverse document frequency (idf) to favor discriminative terms during retrieval. In this work, we propose to learn TDVs for document indexing with shallow neural networks that approximate traditional IR ranking functions such as TF-IDF and BM25. Our proposal outperforms, both in terms of nDCG and recall, traditional approaches, even with few positively labelled query-document pairs as learning data. Our learned TDVs, when used to filter out terms of the vocabulary that have zero discrimination value, allow to both significantly lower the memory footprint of the inverted index and speed up the retrieval process (BM25 is up to 3~times faster), without degrading retrieval quality.",

        "summary": "Neural entity typing models typically represent fine-grained entity types as vectors in a high-dimensional space, but such spaces are not well-suited to modeling these types' complex interdependencies. We study the ability of box embeddings, which embed concepts as d-dimensional hyperrectangles, to capture hierarchies of types even when these relationships are not defined explicitly in the ontology. Our model represents both types and entity mentions as boxes. Each mention and its context are fed into a BERT-based model to embed that mention in our box space; essentially, this model leverages typological clues present in the surface text to hypothesize a type representation for the mention. Box containment can then be used to derive both the posterior probability of a mention exhibiting a given type and the conditional probability relations between types themselves. We compare our approach with a vector-based typing model and observe state-of-the-art performance on several entity typing benchmarks. In addition to competitive typing performance, our box-based model shows better performance in prediction consistency (predicting a supertype and a subtype together) and confidence (i.e., calibration), demonstrating that the box-based model captures the latent type hierarchies better than the vector-based model does.",

        "summary": "Deep learning has profoundly impacted many areas of machine learning. However, it took a while for its impact to be felt in the field of recommender systems. In this article, we outline some of the challenges encountered and lessons learned in using deep learning for recommender systems at Netflix. We first provide an overview of the various recommendation tasks on the Netflix service. We found that different model architectures excel at different tasks. Even though many deep-learning models can be understood as extensions of existing (simple) recommendation algorithms, we initially did not observe significant improvements in performance over well-tuned non-deep-learning approaches. Only when we added numerous features of heterogeneous types to the input data, deep-learning models did start to shine in our setting. We also observed that deep-learning methods can exacerbate the problem of offlineonline metric (mis-)alignment. After addressing these challenges, deep learning has ultimately resulted in large improvements to our recommendations as measured by both offline and online metrics. On the practical side, integrating deep-learning toolboxes in our system has made it faster and easier to implement and experiment with both deep-learning and non-deep-learning approaches for various recommendation tasks. We conclude this article by summarizing our take-aways that may generalize to other applications beyond Netflix.",

        "summary": "In this work, we aim to connect two research areas: instruction models and retrieval-based models. While instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at extracting information from text, they are not suitable for semantic retrieval. Similarity search over embedding vectors allows to index and query vectors, but the similarity reflected in the embedding is sub-optimal for many use cases. We identify the task of retrieving sentences based on abstract descriptions of their content. We demonstrate the inadequacy of current text embeddings and propose an alternative model that significantly improves when used in standard nearest neighbor search. The model is trained using positive and negative pairs sourced through prompting an a large language model (LLM). While it is easy to source the training material from an LLM, the retrieval task cannot be performed by the LLM directly. This demonstrates that data from LLMs can be used not only for distilling more efficient specialized models than the original LLM, but also for creating new capabilities not immediately possible using the original model.",

        "summary": "Recently, InPars introduced a method to efficiently use large language models (LLMs) in information retrieval tasks: via few-shot examples, an LLM is induced to generate relevant queries for documents. These synthetic query-document pairs can then be used to train a retriever. However, InPars and, more recently, Promptagator, rely on proprietary LLMs such as GPT-3 and FLAN to generate such datasets. In this work we introduce InPars-v2, a dataset generator that uses open-source LLMs and existing powerful rerankers to select synthetic query-document pairs for training. A simple BM25 retrieval pipeline followed by a monoT5 reranker finetuned on InPars-v2 data achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BEIR benchmark. To allow researchers to further improve our method, we open source the code, synthetic data, and finetuned models: https://github.com/zetaalphavector/inPars/tree/master/tpu",

        "summary": "Search methods based on Pretrained Language Models (PLM) have demonstrated great effectiveness gains compared to statistical and early neural ranking models. However, fine-tuning PLM-based rankers requires a great amount of annotated training data. Annotating data involves a large manual effort and thus is expensive, especially in domain specific tasks. In this paper we investigate fine-tuning PLM-based rankers under limited training data and budget. We investigate two scenarios: fine-tuning a ranker from scratch, and domain adaptation starting with a ranker already fine-tuned on general data, and continuing fine-tuning on a target dataset. We observe a great variability in effectiveness when fine-tuning on different randomly selected subsets of training data. This suggests that it is possible to achieve effectiveness gains by actively selecting a subset of the training data that has the most positive effect on the rankers. This way, it would be possible to fine-tune effective PLM rankers at a reduced annotation budget. To investigate this, we adapt existing Active Learning (AL) strategies to the task of fine-tuning PLM rankers and investigate their effectiveness, also considering annotation and computational costs. Our extensive analysis shows that AL strategies do not significantly outperform random selection of training subsets in terms of effectiveness. We further find that gains provided by AL strategies come at the expense of more assessments (thus higher annotation costs) and AL strategies underperform random selection when comparing effectiveness given a fixed annotation cost. Our results highlight that ``optimal'' subsets of training data that provide high effectiveness at low annotation cost do exist, but current mainstream AL strategies applied to PLM rankers are not capable of identifying them.",

However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.",

Just one year ago, chatbots were out of fashion and most people hadn't heard about techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback RLHF to align language models with human preferences. Then, OpenAI broke the internet with ChatGPT and Meta followed suit by releasing the Llama series of language models which enabled the ML community to build their very own capable chatbots. This has led to a rich ecosystem of datasets and models that have mostly focused on teaching language models to follow instructions through supervised fine-tuning SFT.",

        "summary": "We aim to produce a smaller language model that is aligned to user intent. Previous research has shown that applying distilled supervised fine-tuning (dSFT) on larger models significantly improves task accuracy; however, these models are unaligned, i.e. they do not respond well to natural prompts. To distill this property, we experiment with the use of preference data from AI Feedback (AIF). Starting from a dataset of outputs ranked by a teacher model, we apply distilled direct preference optimization (dDPO) to learn a chat model with significantly improved intent alignment. The approach requires only a few hours of training without any additional sampling during fine-tuning. The final result, Zephyr-7B, sets the state-of-the-art on chat benchmarks for 7B parameter models, and requires no human annotation. In particular, results on MT-Bench show that Zephyr-7B surpasses Llama2-Chat-70B, the best open-access RLHF-based model. Code, models, data, and tutorials for the system are available at https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook.",

        "summary": "Recent studies have shown that Dense Retrieval (DR) techniques can significantly improve the performance of first-stage retrieval in IR systems. Despite its empirical effectiveness, the application of DR is still limited. In contrast to statistic retrieval models that rely on highly efficient inverted index solutions, DR models build dense embeddings that are difficult to be pre-processed with most existing search indexing systems. To avoid the expensive cost of brute-force search, the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm and corresponding indexes are widely applied to speed up the inference process of DR models. Unfortunately, while ANN can improve the efficiency of DR models, it usually comes with a significant price on retrieval performance. To solve this issue, we propose JTR, which stands for Joint optimization of TRee-based index and query encoding. Specifically, we design a new unified contrastive learning loss to train tree-based index and query encoder in an end-to-end manner. The tree-based negative sampling strategy is applied to make the tree have the maximum heap property, which supports the effectiveness of beam search well. Moreover, we treat the cluster assignment as an optimization problem to update the tree-based index that allows overlapped clustering. We evaluate JTR on numerous popular retrieval benchmarks. Experimental results show that JTR achieves better retrieval performance while retaining high system efficiency compared with widely-adopted baselines. It provides a potential solution to balance efficiency and effectiveness in neural retrieval system designs.",

To jointly optimize index structure and query encoder in an end-to-end manner, JTR drops the original encoding-indexing training paradigm and designs a unified contrastive learning loss. However, training tree-based indexes using contrastive learning loss is non-trivial due to the problem of differentiability. To overcome this obstacle, the tree-based index is divided into two parts cluster node embeddings and cluster assignment. For differentiable cluster node embeddings, which are small but very critical, we design tree-based negative sampling to optimize them. For cluster assignment, an overlapped cluster method is applied to iteratively optimize it.",

        "summary": "Neural entity typing models typically represent fine-grained entity types as vectors in a high-dimensional space, but such spaces are not well-suited to modeling these types' complex interdependencies. We study the ability of box embeddings, which embed concepts as d-dimensional hyperrectangles, to capture hierarchies of types even when these relationships are not defined explicitly in the ontology. Our model represents both types and entity mentions as boxes. Each mention and its context are fed into a BERT-based model to embed that mention in our box space; essentially, this model leverages typological clues present in the surface text to hypothesize a type representation for the mention. Box containment can then be used to derive both the posterior probability of a mention exhibiting a given type and the conditional probability relations between types themselves. We compare our approach with a vector-based typing model and observe state-of-the-art performance on several entity typing benchmarks. In addition to competitive typing performance, our box-based model shows better performance in prediction consistency (predicting a supertype and a subtype together) and confidence (i.e., calibration), demonstrating that the box-based model captures the latent type hierarchies better than the vector-based model does.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolving by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been a crucial component in the recent success of Large Language Models. However, RLHF is know to exploit biases in human preferences, such as verbosity. A well-formatted and eloquent answer is often more highly rated by users, even when it is less helpful and objective. A number of approaches have been developed to control those biases in the classical RLHF literature, but the problem remains relatively under-explored for Direct Alignment Algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike classical RLHF, DPO does not train a separate reward model or use reinforcement learning directly, so previous approaches developed to control verbosity cannot be directly applied to this setting. Our work makes several contributions. For the first time, we study the length problem in the DPO setting, showing significant exploitation in DPO and linking it to out-of-distribution bootstrapping. We then develop a principled but simple regularization strategy that prevents length exploitation, while still maintaining improvements in model quality. We demonstrate these effects across datasets on summarization and dialogue, where we achieve up to 20\\% improvement in win rates when controlling for length, despite the GPT4 judge's well-known verbosity bias.",

Building natural language interfaces has traditionally been difficult. These apps often relied on complex decision trees to determine intent and collect the required inputs to take action. Large language models LLMs have made this easier by enabling us to take natural language input from a user and match to intent. This has introduced its own challenges including the need to constrain the model's reply for safety, structure responses from the model for further processing, and ensuring that the reply from the model is valid. Prompt engineering aims to solve these problems, but comes with a steep learning curve and increased fragility as the prompt increases in size.",

        "summary": "gradient scienceAbout RSS feed Contact\nContextCite: Attributing Model Generation to Context\nBenjamin Cohen-Wang, Harshay Shah, Kristian Georgiev, Aleksander Madry  \u2022  May 6, 2024\n12 minute read\n    Code      Demo      Paper coming soon  \n\nLanguage models may need external information to provide a response to a given query. A user would provide this information to a language model as context and then expect the model to interact with this context when responding to the query.\n\nFor example, suppose that I want to use an AI assistant like ChatGPT to help me plan a trip to see a solar eclipse this week. I would first need to provide it with relevant documents about the path of the eclipse and weather forecasts. Then, I could ask it to use this information to compile an itinerary.\n\nUpon seeing the generated response, I might ask: is everything accurate? Did the model misinterpret anything or make something up? Is the response actually grounded in the provided context?\n\nWe introduce ContextCite, a method that can help answer these questions. Here\u2019s an example of what it can do (check out our demo and Python package to play around with it yourself):\n\n\n\nAs we see in the figure above, ContextCite finds that the sentence \u201cThe weather in Burlington should be sunny, with mostly clear skies \u2026\u201d is responsible for the model stating that \u201cThe weather forecast for Burlington is sunny \u2026\u201d. This checks out!\n\nBut as we know, models can sometimes act in unpredictable ways. Consider the following example:\n\nPanel L\nPanel R backgound\nPanel R backgound\nHere, the language model generates a long answer containing multiple statements. Using ContextCite, we can pinpoint the parts of the provided context (if any) that are responsible for a given statement. Try it out yourself by hovering over the highlighted output sentences.\n\nSo, how does ContextCite work? In the rest of this blog post, we will explain this in detail. To this end, we first define the task of context attribution: pinpointing the parts of the context that are responsible for a given generated statement. Then, we describe ContextCite, a simple and scalable method for context attribution, and benchmark its effectiveness against a few natural baselines. In a follow up blog post, we explore using ContextCite to detect misinterpretations, unverified statements and poisons within the context. We are excited about how context attribution can help make LLMs into more reliable tools!\n\nWhat is Context Attribution?\n\nIntuitively, the goal of context attribution is to trace a part of the generated response back to a piece of the context. Specifically, suppose that we are given a context ?and query Q\nQ\n. For example, the context might be a bunch of articles about the most recent Olympics and the query might be \u201cWho won the most medals?\u201d To perform context attribution, we first partition the context ? into individual sources ?1,\n1\n,\n?2,\u2026,\n2\n,\n\u2026\n,\n?n\nn\n. We can partition at any desired granularity: for example, the sources can be the articles, paragraphs or sentences within the articles, or even individual words. In the rest of this blog post, we will consider sources to be sentences.\n\nNow that we have our sources, we are ready to perform attribution. A context attribution method \u03c4\n\u03c4\n accepts a part of the generated response (a subset of the tokens corresponding to a statement of interest) and assigns a score to each source. This score is intended to signify the \u201cimportance\u201d of the source to generating this statement:\n\n\n\nIn practice, we might want an attribution set, i.e., a set of the most relevant sources. To obtain such a set, we can apply a threshold to our scores as a post-processing step.\n\nWhat do context attributions scores signify?\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve only said that scores should signify how \u201cimportant\u201d a source is for generating a particular statement. But what does this actually mean? There are two types of attribution that users might care about.\n\nCorroborative attribution identifies sources that support or imply a statement. Meanwhile, contributive attribution identifies the sources that cause a model to generate a statement. If a statement is accurate, then its corroborative and contributive sources may very well be the same. However, if a statement is inaccurate, corroborative and contributive attribution methods would likely behave differently. Indeed, suppose, for example, that a model misinterprets a fact in the context. A corroborative method might not find any attributions (because nothing in the context supports its statement). On the other hand, a contributive method would identify the fact that the model misinterpreted.\n\nThere are several existing methods for corroborative attribution of language models. These typically involve explicitly training or prompting models to produce citations along with each statement they make. Many AI-powered search products provide these types of citations (they remain hard to verify).\n\nContextCite, however, provides contributive attributions. As we will see, this type of attribution gives rise to a diverse and distinct set of use cases and applications compared to existing corroborative methods (e.g., detecting misinterpretations, finding poisoned contexts).\n\nEvaluating the quality of attributions\nHow can we assess the quality of a contributive attribution method? Intuitively, if a source is important, then removing this source should change the response significantly. Following this intuition, one way to evaluate a context attribution method is to see what happens when we remove the k\nk\n highest-scoring sources. Specifically, we measure how much the log-probability assigned by the model to the original response drops:\n\n\n\nIn this example, the highest-scoring source is the key piece of the context from which the model concludes that cacti have spines \u201cas a defense mechanism against herbivores and to assist in water conservation.\u201d When we remove it, the probability of this response decreases substantially, indicating that this source is indeed important. More generally, if removing the highest-scoring sources of one attribution method causes a larger drop than removing those of another, then we consider the former method to be more accurate.\n\nContextCite\n\nWe have established that a context attribution method is effective insofar as it identifies sources that would significantly alter the response if they weren\u2019t present. Can we model this process directly? That is, is there a simple model that predicts how the probability of the original response would change when we exclude a subset of the sources?\n\nAside: we\u2019ve explored a similar line of thinkingunderstanding via surrogate modelingin our work on datamodeling and component modeling. For example, in datamodeling, a linear surrogate model encodes how every example in the training dataset contributes to the model prediction on a given test example. As we will see, the types of surrogate models that are effective for datamodeling, namely, sparse linear models with logit-scaled probabilities as targets, also work quite well in the context attribution setting.\n\nIt turns out that the answer is yes! And this is exactly what drives the design of ContextCite. Specifically, ContextCite comprises the following steps:\n\nGenerate a response for the given context and query (nothing new here).\nRandomly ablate the sources in the context (i.e., pick a fraction of the sources to exclude and construct a modified context without them). Then, compute the probability of generating the original response. Repeat this several times to create a \u201ctraining dataset\u201d of ablation masks and the resulting probabilities.\nFit a surrogate model to estimate the probability of generating the original response as a function of the ablation mask.\nThe figure below summarizes ContextCite:\n\n\n\nIn practice, we find that (just as in datamodeling) a linear surrogate model predicting logit-scaled probabilities is quite effective!\n\n Why do we perform logit-scaling? (Click to expand)\n[0,1]\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n[0,1]\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n(\u2212\u221e,\u221e)\n(\n\u2212\n\u221e\n,\n\u221e\n)\n\n\nWe can then treat this surrogate model\u2019s weights as attribution scores denoting the importance of each source to the generated content.\n\nSparsity to the Rescue!\nA natural question to now ask is: how many random context ablations do we need to compute to get an accurate surrogate model? Since we\u2019re solving a linear regression problem, we would expect the number of ablations to scale linearly with the number of sources. But given that each ablation that the surrogate model learns from requires an additional inference pass of the model that we\u2019re attributing, we would want to keep the number of ablations lower than that.\n\nIt turns out that ContextCite is able to learn an accurate surrogate model with a significantly smaller number of ablations by exploiting underlying sparsity. In particular, in many cases a statement generated by the model can be explained well by just a handful of sources. This means that most sources should have very little influence on a particular statement. Hence, we can use Lasso to learn a sparse (yet still accurate) linear surrogate model using a very small number of ablations.\n\n Why do we only need a small number of ablations? (Click to expand)\n1/2\n1\n/\n2\nO(slog(n))\nO\n(\ns\nlog\n\u2061\n(\nn\n)\n)\nn\nn\ns\ns\n\n\nIndeed, in our demo and evaluations, we can use only 32 ablations even when the context consists of hundreds of sources!\n\nThe following figure shows the weights of the surrogate model used by ContextCite to attribute a Mistral-7B-Instruct model\u2019s response to the question \u201cCan you over-water a cactus?\u201d using the Wikipedia article about cacti as context.\n\n\n\nIn the middle, we can see that there are three sentences in the entire Wikipedia article with weights much higher than the restthese three sentences are primarily responsible for the response. On the right, we show the surrogate model\u2019s predictions of the logit-probabilities and the actual logit-probabilities for a bunch of random context ablations and for the entire context. The surrogate model appears to be quite accurate! The \u201cvertical clusters\u201d are caused by the sparsity induced by the \u21131\n\u2113\n1\n-regularization used in Lasso: most of the model\u2019s prediction is determined by the presence or absence of each of the three key sentences.\n\nConnections to prior work\nBesides datamodeling and component modeling, several works have explored using surrogate models to explain and attribute model behavior. We have thought about this a lot in the past. Other recent work has applied datamodels to the in-context learning setting to select better examples to show as demonstrations. In the interpretability literature, LIME uses local sparse linear surrogate models to explain a model\u2019s prediction in terms of features.\n\nHow effective are ContextCite attributions?\n\nContextCite is designed to identify the sources in the context that explain why a model generated a particular piece of content. How effective is it at doing so? We benchmark ContextCite against three natural baselines for context attribution adapted from prior work:\n\nAttention: following works discussing attention as an explanation for language model behavior, we average the last-layer attention score of the selected response to attribute to each of the sources.\nSimilarity: we embed the selection to attribute and each of the sources using an off-the-shelf pre-trained model, and treat the embedding cosine similarities as attribution scores.\nGradient: we compute the gradient of the selection to attribute with respect to each source, and treat the norms of the gradients as attribution scores.\nAs we discussed before, we quantify the effectiveness of an attribution method by ablating the k\nk\n highest-scoring sources and measuring the drop in the log-probability of the original response (normalized by the length of the response). Across different tasks, ContextCite consistently outperforms baselines:\n\n\n\nFor a more fine-grained evaluation, we also consider whether attribution scores can accurately rank the effects of ablating different sets of sources. In the data attribution literature, the linear datamodeling score (LDS) measures exactly this (there, it ranks the effects of ablating different sets of training examples). In terms of LDS too, we find that ContextCite outperforms baselines:\n\n\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve seen that ContextCite learns accurate contributive attributions. Indeed this is what ContextCite is designed to do. However, we might also be interested to see if ContextCite identifies the ground-truth sources for a query when they are available. The Hotpot QA dataset above includes an annotation of the precise list of sentences needed to answer each question. We find that ContextCite is also effective at identifying these ground-truth sources, compared to baselines:\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we introduce the problem of context attribution: pinpointing the parts of the context that are responsible for specific statements generated by a language model. We present ContextCite, a scalable method for context attribution that can be flexibly applied to any existing language model.\n\nIn the next post, we dive deeper into how we can use ContextCite to determine whether we should trust the content generated by language models.

The retriever component is usually a variant of the Dense Passage Retriever, which computes the similarities between questions and tables based on a single representation of each. These fixed vectors can be insufficient to capture fine-grained features of potentially very big tables with heterogeneous row/column information. We address this limitation by 1) applying late interaction models which enforce a finer-grained interaction between question and table embeddings at retrieval time. In addition, we 2) incorporate a joint training scheme of the retriever and reader with explicit table-level signals, and 3) embed a binary relevance token as a prefix to the answer generated by the reader, so we can determine at inference time whether the table used to answer the question is reliable and filter accordingly. The combined strategies set a new state-to-the-art performance on two public open-domain TableQA datasets.",

Late interaction, introduced with the ColBERT model and recently refined in ColBERTv2, is a popular paradigm that holds state-of-the-art status across many benchmarks. To dramatically speed up the search latency of late interaction, we introduce the Performance-optimized Late Interaction Driver (PLAID). Without impacting quality, PLAID swiftly eliminates low-scoring passages using a novel centroid interaction mechanism that treats every passage as a lightweight bag of centroids. PLAID uses centroid interaction as well as centroid pruning, a mechanism for sparsifying the bag of centroids, within a highly-optimized engine to reduce late interaction search latency by up to 7$\\times$ on a GPU and 45$\\times$ on a CPU against vanilla ColBERTv2, while continuing to deliver state-of-the-art retrieval quality. This allows the PLAID engine with ColBERTv2 to achieve latency of tens of milliseconds on a GPU and tens or just few hundreds of milliseconds on a CPU at large scale, even at the largest scales we evaluate with 140M passages.",

While existing large vision models excel in transfer learning, they struggle to perform a diversity of tasks with simple instructions, a capability that implies handling the complexity of various spatial hierarchy and semantic granularity. Florence-2 was designed to take text-prompt as task instructions and generate desirable results in text forms, whether it be captioning, object detection, grounding or segmentation. This multi-task learning setup demands large-scale, high-quality annotated data. To this end, we co-developed FLD-5B that consists of 5.4 billion comprehensive visual annotations on 126 million images, using an iterative strategy of automated image annotation and model refinement.

        "summary": "Pretrained deep-learning models are the go-to solution for images or text. However, for tabular data the standard is still to train tree-based models. Indeed, transfer learning on tables hits the challenge of data integration: finding correspondences, correspondences in the entries (entity matching) where different words may denote the same entity, correspondences across columns (schema matching), which may come in different orders, names... We propose a neural architecture that does not need such correspondences. As a result, we can pretrain it on background data that has not been matched. The architecture -- CARTE for Context Aware Representation of Table Entries -- uses a graph representation of tabular (or relational) data to process tables with different columns, string embedding of entries and columns names to model an open vocabulary, and a graph-attentional network to contextualize entries with column names and neighboring entries. An extensive benchmark shows that CARTE facilitates learning, outperforming a solid set of baselines including the best tree-based models. CARTE also enables joint learning across tables with unmatched columns, enhancing a small table with bigger ones. CARTE opens the door to large pretrained models for tabular data.",

To accelerate sampling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more efficient class of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as DDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is defined as the reverse of a Markovian diffusion process. We construct a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that lead to the same training objective, but whose reverse process can be much faster to sample from. We empirically demonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples $10 \\times$ to $50 \\times$ faster in terms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation for sample quality, and can perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly in the latent space.",

From having a visual assistant that could guide us through unfamiliar environments to generative models that produce images using only a high-level text description, the vision-language model (VLM) applications will significantly impact our relationship with technology. However, there are many challenges that need to be addressed to improve the reliability of those models. While language is discrete, vision evolves in a much higher dimensional space in which concepts cannot always be easily discretized. To better understand the mechanics behind mapping vision to language, we present this introduction to VLMs which we hope will help anyone who would like to enter the field. First, we introduce what VLMs are, how they work, and how to train them. Then, we present and discuss approaches to evaluate VLMs. Although this work primarily focuses on mapping images to language, we also discuss extending VLMs to videos.",

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

As the table retrieval component we introduce Tab-GTR, a text retrieval model augmented with table structure embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NQ-Tables benchmark with 48.88% R@1. On in-distribution data, the DePlot-based method (b) outperforms PaLI-3 (c), while being significantly more efficient (300M vs 3B trainable parameters). However, DePlot struggles with complex charts, indicating a need for improvements in chart derendering - specifically in terms of chart data diversity and the richness of text/table representations.

        "summary": "Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. BRIGHT is constructed from the 1,398 real-world queries collected from diverse domains (such as economics, psychology, robotics, software engineering, earth sciences, etc.), sourced from naturally occurring or carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard [38 ], which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10,2 produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.0 on BRIGHT. We further demonstrate that augmenting queries with Chain-of-Thought reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) improves performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, BRIGHT is robust against data leakage during pretraining of the benchmarked models as we validate by showing similar performance even when documents from the benchmark are included in the training data. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings. Our code and data are available at https://brightbenchmark.github.io.",

        "summary": "Text embedding models have been popular for information retrieval applications such as semantic search and Question-Answering systems based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Those models are typically Transformer models that are fine-tuned with contrastive learning objectives. Many papers introduced new embedding model architectures and training approaches, however, one of the key ingredients, the process of mining negative passages, remains poorly explored or described. One of the challenging aspects of fine-tuning embedding models is the selection of high quality hard-negative passages for contrastive learning. In this paper we propose a family of positive-aware mining methods that leverage the positive relevance score for more effective false negatives removal. We also provide a comprehensive ablation study on hard-negative mining methods over their configurations, exploring different teacher and base models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods by introducing the NV-Retriever-v1 model, which scores 60.9 on MTEB Retrieval (BEIR) benchmark and 0.65 points higher than previous methods. The model placed 1st when it was published to MTEB Retrieval on July 07, 2024.",

MINT-1T comprises one trillion text tokens and 3.4 billion images, a 10x scale-up from existing open-source datasets. Additionally, we include previously untapped sources such as PDFs and ArXiv papers. As scaling multimodal interleaved datasets requires substantial engineering effort, sharing the data curation process and releasing the dataset greatly benefits the community.

While training these layers is generally fast and simple, due to parallelizability across the length of the sequence, incremental inference (where such paralleization is impossible) is often slow, due to the memory-bandwidth cost of repeatedly loading the large \"keys\" and \"values\" tensors. We propose a variant called multi-query attention, where the keys and values are shared across all of the different attention \"heads\", greatly reducing the size of these tensors and hence the memory bandwidth requirements of incremental decoding. We verify experimentally that the resulting models can indeed be much faster to decode, and incur only minor quality degradation from the baseline.",

        "summary": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) represent human-crafted factual knowledge in the form of triplets (head, relation, tail), which collectively form a graph. Question Answering over KGs (KGQA) is the task of answering natural questions grounding the reasoning to the information provided by the KG. Large Language Models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models for QA tasks due to their remarkable ability to understand natural language. On the other hand, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for KGQA as they can handle the complex graph information stored in the KG. In this work, we introduce GNN-RAG, a novel method for combining language understanding abilities of LLMs with the reasoning abilities of GNNs in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style. First, a GNN reasons over a dense KG subgraph to retrieve answer candidates for a given question. Second, the shortest paths in the KG that connect question entities and answer candidates are extracted to represent KG reasoning paths. The extracted paths are verbalized and given as input for LLM reasoning with RAG. In our GNN-RAG framework, the GNN acts as a dense subgraph reasoner to extract useful graph information, while the LLM leverages its natural language processing ability for ultimate KGQA. Furthermore, we develop a retrieval augmentation (RA) technique to further boost KGQA performance with GNN-RAG. Experimental results show that GNN-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in two widely used KGQA benchmarks (WebQSP and CWQ), outperforming or matching GPT-4 performance with a 7B tuned LLM. In addition, GNN-RAG excels on multi-hop and multi-entity questions outperforming competing approaches by 8.9--15.5% points at answer F1.",

        "summary": "We introduce Bonito, an open-source model for conditional task generation that converts unannotated text into task-specific training datasets for instruction tuning. We aim to enable zero-shot task adaptation of large language models on users' specialized, private data. We train Bonito by fine-tuning a pretrained large language model on a new large-scale dataset with 1.65M examples created by remixing existing instruction tuning datasets into meta-templates. The meta-templates for a dataset produce training examples where the input is the unannotated text and the task attribute and the output consists of the instruction and the response. We use Bonito to generate synthetic tasks for seven datasets from specialized domains with unannotated text across three task types -- yes-no question answering, extractive question answering, and natural language inference -- and adapt language models. We show that Bonito significantly improves the average performance of pretrained and instruction tuned models over the de facto self supervised baseline. For example, adapting Mistral-Instruct-v2 and instruction tuned variants of Mistral and Llama2 with Bonito improves the strong zero-shot performance by 22.1 F1 points whereas the next word prediction objective undoes some of the benefits of instruction tuning and reduces the average performance by 0.8 F1 points. We conduct additional experiments with Bonito to understand the effects of the domain, the size of the training set, and the choice of alternative synthetic task generators. Overall, we show that learning with synthetic instruction tuning datasets is an effective way to adapt language models to new domains. The model, dataset, and code are available at https://github.com/BatsResearch/bonito.",

The issue is exacerbated when the task involves complex structured outputs, as it becomes harder to design procedures which address this misalignment. In natural language processing, this is often addressed using reinforcement learning techniques that align models with a task reward. We adopt this approach and show its surprising effectiveness across multiple computer vision tasks, such as object detection, panoptic segmentation, colorization and image captioning. We believe this approach has the potential to be widely useful for better aligning models with a diverse range of computer vision tasks.",

        "summary": "Contrastive pretraining on image-text pairs from the web is one of the most popular large-scale pretraining strategies for vision backbones, especially in the context of large multimodal models. At the same time, image captioning on this type of data is commonly considered an inferior pretraining strategy. In this paper, we perform a fair comparison of these two pretraining strategies, carefully matching training data, compute, and model capacity. Using a standard encoder-decoder transformer, we find that captioning alone is surprisingly effective: on classification tasks, captioning produces vision encoders competitive with contrastively pretrained encoders, while surpassing them on vision & language tasks. We further analyze the effect of the model architecture and scale, as well as the pretraining data on the representation quality, and find that captioning exhibits the same or better scaling behavior along these axes. Overall our results show that plain image captioning is a more powerful pretraining strategy than was previously believed.",

However, models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) offer flexible sequence-based modeling, and hence varying input sequence lengths. We take advantage of this with NaViT (Native Resolution ViT) which uses sequence packing during training to process inputs of arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. Alongside flexible model usage, we demonstrate improved training efficiency for large-scale supervised and contrastive image-text pretraining. NaViT can be efficiently transferred to standard tasks such as image and video classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation and leads to improved results on robustness and fairness benchmarks. At inference time, the input resolution flexibility can be used to smoothly navigate the test-time cost-performance trade-off. We believe that NaViT marks a departure from the standard, CNN-designed, input and modelling pipeline used by most computer vision models, and represents a promising direction for ViTs.",

We first pre-train iHT on a large KG dataset, Wikidata5M. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on matched evaluations, with a relative improvement of more than 25% in mean reciprocal rank over previous SOTA models. When further fine-tuned on smaller KGs with either entity and relational shifts, pre-trained iHT representations are shown to be transferable, significantly improving the performance on FB15K-237 and WN18RR.",

        "summary": "Neural embedding models have become a fundamental component of modern information retrieval (IR) pipelines. These models produce a single embedding $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ per data-point, allowing for fast retrieval via highly optimized maximum inner product search (MIPS) algorithms. Recently, beginning with the landmark ColBERT paper, multi-vector models, which produce a set of embedding per data point, have achieved markedly superior performance for IR tasks. Unfortunately, using these models for IR is computationally expensive due to the increased complexity of multi-vector retrieval and scoring. In this paper, we introduce MUVERA (MUlti-VEctor Retrieval Algorithm), a retrieval mechanism which reduces multi-vector similarity search to single-vector similarity search. This enables the usage of off-the-shelf MIPS solvers for multi-vector retrieval. MUVERA asymmetrically generates Fixed Dimensional Encodings (FDEs) of queries and documents, which are vectors whose inner product approximates multi-vector similarity. We prove that FDEs give high-quality $\\epsilon$-approximations, thus providing the first single-vector proxy for multi-vector similarity with theoretical guarantees. Empirically, we find that FDEs achieve the same recall as prior state-of-the-art heuristics while retrieving 2-5$\\times$ fewer candidates. Compared to prior state of the art implementations, MUVERA achieves consistently good end-to-end recall and latency across a diverse set of the BEIR retrieval datasets, achieving an average of 10$\\%$ improved recall with $90\\%$ lower latency.",

        "summary": "Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\\'e ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.",

The resulting recipe, which we obtain through extensive experiments, can be used by practitioners to make informed design choices for their embedding models.

        "summary": "Generative models trained at scale can now produce text, video, and more recently, scientific data such as crystal structures. In applications of generative approaches to materials science, and in particular to crystal structures, the guidance from the domain expert in the form of high-level instructions can be essential for an automated system to output candidate crystals that are viable for downstream research. In this work, we formulate end-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for controllable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language model that takes high-level natural language as input and generates intermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and (2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and generates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally uses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from the generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three components to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible structures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of directly using language models to generate structures both in satisfying user request and in generating low-energy structures. We confirm that GenMS is able to generate common crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels, solely from natural language input, and hence can form the foundation for more complex structure generation in near future.",

We first propose Latent Graph Diffusion (LGD), a generative model that can generate node, edge, and graph-level features of all categories simultaneously. We achieve this goal by embedding the graph structures and features into a latent space leveraging a powerful encoder which can also be decoded, then training a diffusion model in the latent space. LGD is also capable of conditional generation through a specifically designed cross-attention mechanism. Then we formulate prediction tasks including regression and classification as (conditional) generation, which enables our LGD to solve tasks of all levels and all types with provable guarantees. We verify the effectiveness of our framework with extensive experiments, where our models achieve state-of-the-art or highly competitive results across generation and regression tasks.",

However, while complex symbolic datasets often exhibit a latent hierarchical structure, state-of-the-art methods typically learn embeddings in Euclidean vector spaces, which do not account for this property. For this purpose, we introduce a new approach for learning hierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic space -- or more precisely into an n-dimensional Poincar\\'e ball. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, this allows us to learn parsimonious representations of symbolic data by simultaneously capturing hierarchy and similarity. We introduce an efficient algorithm to learn the embeddings based on Riemannian optimization and show experimentally that Poincar\\'e embeddings outperform Euclidean embeddings significantly on data with latent hierarchies, both in terms of representation capacity and in terms of generalization ability.",

In this work, we propose a novel instruction fine-tuning framework RankRAG, which instruction-tunes a single LLM for the dual purpose of context ranking and answer generation in RAG. In particular, the instruction-tuned LLMs work surprisingly well by adding a small fraction of ranking data into the training blend, and outperform existing expert ranking models, including the same LLM exclusively fine-tuned on a large amount of ranking data. For generation, we compare our model with many strong baselines, including GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-turbo-2024-0409, and ChatQA-1.5, an open-sourced model with the state-of-the-art performance on RAG benchmarks. Specifically, our Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks. In addition, it also performs comparably to GPT-4 on five RAG benchmarks in the biomedical domain without instruction fine-tuning on biomedical data, demonstrating its superb capability for generalization to new domains.",

Our goal is to elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks.

In response to these challenges, we introduce TableRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for LM-based table understanding. TableRAG leverages query expansion combined with schema and cell retrieval to pinpoint crucial information before providing it to the LMs. This enables more efficient data encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and mitigating information loss. We have developed two new million-token benchmarks from the Arcade and BIRD-SQL datasets to thoroughly evaluate TableRAG's effectiveness at scale. Our results demonstrate that TableRAG's retrieval design achieves the highest retrieval quality, leading to the new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale table understanding.",

        "summary": "Scaling laws with respect to the amount of training data and the number of parameters allow us to predict the cost-benefit trade-offs of pretraining language models (LMs) in different configurations. In this paper, we consider another dimension of scaling: the amount of data available at inference time. Specifically, we find that increasing the size of the datastore used by a retrieval-based LM monotonically improves language modeling and several downstream tasks without obvious saturation, such that a smaller model augmented with a large datastore outperforms a larger LM-only model on knowledge-intensive tasks. By plotting compute-optimal scaling curves with varied datastore, model, and pretraining data sizes, we show that using larger datastores can significantly improve model performance for the same training compute budget. We carry out our study by constructing a 1.4 trillion-token datastore named MassiveDS, which is the largest and the most diverse open-sourced datastore for retrieval-based LMs to date, and designing an efficient pipeline for studying datastore scaling in a computationally accessible manner. Finally, we analyze the effect of improving the retriever, datastore quality filtering, and other design choices on our observed scaling trends. Overall, our results show that datastore size should be considered as an integral part of LM efficiency and performance trade-offs.

        "summary": "Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph-based machine learning. Despite their effectiveness, MPNNs face challenges such as under-reaching and over-squashing, where limited receptive fields and structural bottlenecks hinder information flow in the graph. While graph transformers hold promise in addressing these issues, their scalability is limited due to quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes, rendering them impractical for larger graphs. Here, we propose implicitly rewired message-passing neural networks (IPR-MPNNs), a novel approach that integrates implicit probabilistic graph rewiring into MPNNs. By introducing a small number of virtual nodes, i.e., adding additional nodes to a given graph and connecting them to existing nodes, in a differentiable, end-to-end manner, IPR-MPNNs enable long-distance message propagation, circumventing quadratic complexity. Theoretically, we demonstrate that IPR-MPNNs surpass the expressiveness of traditional MPNNs. Empirically, we validate our approach by showcasing its ability to mitigate under-reaching and over-squashing effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple graph datasets. Notably, IPR-MPNNs outperform graph transformers while maintaining significantly faster computational efficiency.",

        "summary": "To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\\Delta W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ through the product of two matrices $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$ and $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$, where $r \\ll \\min(m, n)$, $A$ is initialized with Gaussian noise, and $B$ with zeros. LoRA freezes the original model $W$ and updates the \"Noise & Zero\" adapter, which may lead to slow convergence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA). PiSSA shares the same architecture as LoRA, but initializes the adaptor matrices $A$ and $B$ with the principal components of the original matrix $W$, and put the remaining components into a residual matrix $W^{res} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ which is frozen during fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, PiSSA updates the principal components while freezing the \"residual\" parts, allowing faster convergence and enhanced performance. Comparative experiments of PiSSA and LoRA across 12 different models, ranging from 184M to 70B, encompassing 5 NLG and 8 NLU tasks, reveal that PiSSA consistently outperforms LoRA under identical experimental setups. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with PiSSA achieves an accuracy of 72.86%, surpassing LoRA's 67.7% by 5.16%. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA is also compatible with quantization to further reduce the memory requirement of fine-tuning. Compared to QLoRA, QPiSSA (PiSSA with 4-bit quantization) exhibits smaller quantization errors in the initial stages. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-70B on GSM8K, QPiSSA attains an accuracy of 86.05%, exceeding the performances of QLoRA at 81.73%. Leveraging a fast SVD technique, PiSSA can be initialized in only a few seconds, presenting a negligible cost for transitioning from LoRA to PiSSA.",

Despite its encouraging prospect, formalization and theoretical insights into this crucial task are still lacking. In this work, we formalize concepts as discrete latent causal variables that are related via a hierarchical causal model that encodes different abstraction levels of concepts embedded in high-dimensional data (e.g., a dog breed and its eye shapes in natural images). We formulate conditions to facilitate the identification of the proposed causal model, which reveals when learning such concepts from unsupervised data is possible. Our conditions permit complex causal hierarchical structures beyond latent trees and multi-level directed acyclic graphs in prior work and can handle high-dimensional, continuous observed variables, which is well-suited for unstructured data modalities such as images. We substantiate our theoretical claims with synthetic data experiments. Further, we discuss our theory's implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of latent diffusion models and provide corresponding empirical evidence for our theoretical insights.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success with their billion-level parameters, yet they incur high inference overheads. The emergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce this cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However, existing methods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity in a post-training setting, overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achieving more structured activation sparsity. To achieve this, we introduce a novel training algorithm, Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), designed to train efficiency-aware LLMs to learn to activate fewer neurons and achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance. Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, which mainly focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like LLaMA using non-ReLU activations. Extensive evaluation on language understanding, language generation, and instruction tuning tasks show that LTE consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Along with our hardware-aware custom kernel implementation, LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B inference latency by 25% at 50% sparsity.",

        "summary": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques are crucial in learning compact representations of entities and relations within a knowledge graph, facilitating efficient reasoning and knowledge discovery. While existing methods typically focus either on training KGE models solely based on graph structure or fine-tuning pre-trained language models with classification data in KG, KG-FIT leverages LLM-guided refinement to construct a semantically coherent hierarchical structure of entity clusters. By incorporating this hierarchical knowledge along with textual information during the fine-tuning process, KG-FIT effectively captures both global semantics from the LLM and local semantics from the KG. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets FB15K-237, YAGO3-10, and PrimeKG demonstrate the superiority of KG-FIT over state-of-the-art pre-trained language model-based methods, achieving improvements of 14.4%, 13.5%, and 11.9% in the Hits@10 metric for the link prediction task, respectively. Furthermore, KG-FIT yields substantial performance gains of 12.6%, 6.7%, and 17.7% compared to the structure-based base models upon which it is built. These results highlight the effectiveness of KG-FIT in incorporating open-world knowledge from LLMs to significantly enhance the expressiveness and informativeness of KG embeddings.",

        "summary": "Ontologies are useful for automatic machine processing of domain knowledge as they represent it in a structured format. Yet, constructing ontologies requires substantial manual effort. To automate part of this process, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to solve various subtasks of ontology learning. However, this partial ontology learning does not capture the interactions between subtasks. We address this gap by introducing OLLM, a general and scalable method for building the taxonomic backbone of an ontology from scratch. Rather than focusing on subtasks, like individual relations between entities, we model entire subcomponents of the target ontology by finetuning an LLM with a custom regulariser that reduces overfitting on high-frequency concepts. We introduce a novel suite of metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated ontology by measuring its semantic and structural similarity to the ground truth. In contrast to standard metrics, our metrics use deep learning techniques to define more robust distance measures between graphs. Both our quantitative and qualitative results on Wikipedia show that OLLM outperforms subtask composition methods, producing more semantically accurate ontologies while maintaining structural integrity. We further demonstrate that our model can be effectively adapted to new domains, like arXiv, needing only a small number of training examples.

We also present the ChatRAG Bench, which encompasses ten datasets covering comprehensive evaluations on RAG, table-related QA, arithmetic calculations, and scenarios involving unanswerable questions. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B (score: 54.14), built on Llama2, a weaker foundation model than GPT-4, can slightly outperform GPT-4-0613 (score: 53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (score: 54.03) on the ChatRAG Bench, without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models. Notably, the Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B model surpasses the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, achieving a 4.4% improvement.

        "summary": "Addressing the challenge of effectively processing long contexts has become a critical issue for Large Language Models (LLMs). Two common strategies have emerged: 1) reducing the input length, such as retrieving relevant chunks by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 2) expanding the context window limit of LLMs. However, both strategies have drawbacks: input reduction has no guarantee of covering the part with needed information, while window extension struggles with focusing on the pertinent information for solving the task. To mitigate these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel framework that harnesses multi-agent collaboration through natural language to enable information aggregation and context reasoning across various LLMs over long-context tasks. CoA consists of multiple worker agents who sequentially communicate to handle different segmented portions of the text, followed by a manager agent who synthesizes these contributions into a coherent final output. CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. We perform comprehensive evaluation of CoA on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion, demonstrating significant improvements by up to 10% over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs.",

To support the development of foundation models for tabular data and relational databases, we introduce WikiDBs, a novel open-source corpus of 100,000 relational databases. Each database consists of multiple tables connected by foreign keys. The corpus is based on Wikidata and aims to follow certain characteristics of real-world databases. In this paper, we describe the dataset and our method for creating it. By making our code publicly available, we enable others to create tailored versions of the dataset, for example, by creating databases in different languages.

Name inspired by Rich Sutton's Bitter Lessonhttpswww.cs.utexas.edueunsolcoursesdatabitterlesson.pdf Over the last few years, the scaling of train-time compute has dominated the progress of LLMs. Although this paradigm has proven to be remarkably effective, the resources needed to pretrain ever larger models are becoming prohibitively expensive, with billion-dollar clusters already on the horizon. This trend has sparked significant interest in a complementary approach test-time compute scaling. Rather than relying on ever-larger pretraining budgets, test-time methods use dynamic inference strategies that allow models to think longer on harder problems. A prominent example is OpenAIs o1 model, which shows consistent improvement on difficult math and coding problems as one increases the amount of test-time compute.",

        "summary": "Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt? Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model\u2019s distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation motivates applying a \u201ccompute-optimal\u201d scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4\u00d7 compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14\u00d7 larger model.",

However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.",

        "summary": "The development of monolingual language models for low and mid-resource languages continues to be hindered by the difficulty in sourcing high-quality training data. In this study, we present a novel cross-lingual vocabulary transfer strategy, trans-tokenization, designed to tackle this challenge and enable more efficient language adaptation. Our approach focuses on adapting a high-resource monolingual LLM to an unseen target language by initializing the token embeddings of the target language using a weighted average of semantically similar token embeddings from the source language. For this, we leverage a translation resource covering both the source and target languages. We validate our method with the Tweeties, a series of trans-tokenized LLMs, and demonstrate their competitive performance on various downstream tasks across a small but diverse set of languages. Additionally, we introduce Hydra LLMs, models with multiple swappable language modeling heads and embedding tables, which further extend the capabilities of our trans-tokenization strategy. By designing a Hydra LLM based on the multilingual model TowerInstruct, we developed a state-of-the-art machine translation model for Tatar, in a zero-shot manner, completely bypassing the need for high-quality parallel data. This breakthrough is particularly significant for low-resource languages like Tatar, where high-quality parallel data is hard to come by. By lowering the data and time requirements for training high-quality models, our trans-tokenization strategy allows for the development of LLMs for a wider range of languages, especially those with limited resources. We hope that our work will inspire further research and collaboration in the field of cross-lingual vocabulary transfer and contribute to the empowerment of languages on a global scale.",

        "summary": "We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

        "summary": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) emerge as a promising approach for process supervision in mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), which aim to identify and mitigate intermediate errors in the reasoning processes. However, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges, particularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior performance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation methods. MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step correctness, leading to inaccurate step verification. Furthermore, we identify potential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for PRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers but flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria of BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification. (2) The tolerance of PRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores. (3) Existing PRMs have a significant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer steps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN Optimized PRMs. To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering mechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and advocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines response-level and step-level metrics. Based on the mechanisms, we significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN evaluation and the step-wise error identification task. Finally, we release a new state-of-the-art PRM that outperforms existing open-source alternatives and provides practical guidelines for future research in building process supervision models.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong effectiveness and robustness while fine-tuned as dense retrievers. However, their large parameter size brings significant inference time computational challenges, including high encoding costs for large-scale corpora and increased query latency, limiting their practical deployment. While smaller retrievers offer better efficiency, they often fail to generalize effectively with limited supervised fine-tuning data. In this work, we introduce DRAMA, a training framework that leverages LLMs to train smaller generalizable dense retrievers. In particular, we adopt pruned LLMs as the backbone and train on diverse LLM-augmented data in a single-stage contrastive learning setup. Experiments show that DRAMA offers better multilingual and long-context capabilities than traditional encoder-based retrievers, and achieves strong performance across multiple tasks and languages. These highlight the potential of connecting the training of smaller retrievers with the growing advancements in LLMs, bridging the gap between efficiency and generalization.",

Pairwise and listwise models allow passage interactions, which typically makes them more effective than pointwise models but less efficient and less robust to input passage order permutations. To enable efficient permutation-invariant passage interactions during re-ranking, we propose a new cross-encoder architecture with inter-passage attention: the Set-Encoder. In experiments on TREC Deep Learning and TIREx, the Set-Encoder is as effective as state-of-the-art listwise models while being more efficient and invariant to input passage order permutations. Compared to pointwise models, the Set-Encoder is particularly more effective when considering inter-passage information, such as novelty, and retains its advantageous properties compared to other listwise models.

However, distilled models do not match the effectiveness of their teacher LLMs. We hypothesize that this effectiveness gap is due to the fact that previous work has not applied the best-suited methods for fine-tuning cross-encoders on manually labeled data (e.g., hard-negative sampling, deep sampling, and listwise loss functions). To close this gap, we create a new dataset, Rank-DistiLLM. Cross-encoders trained on Rank-DistiLLM achieve the effectiveness of LLMs while being up to 173 times faster and 24 times more memory efficient.

Unlike standard contrastive learning with softmax normalization, the sigmoid loss operates solely on image-text pairs and does not require a global view of the pairwise similarities for normalization. The sigmoid loss simultaneously allows further scaling up the batch size, while also performing better at smaller batch sizes. Combined with Locked-image Tuning, with only four TPUv4 chips, we train a SigLiT model that achieves 84.5% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy in two days. The disentanglement of the batch size from the loss further allows us to study the impact of examples vs pairs and negative to positive ratio. Finally, we push the batch size to the extreme, up to one million, and \ufb01nd that the bene\ufb01ts of growing batch size quickly diminish, with a more reasonable batch size of 32 k being suf\ufb01cient. We release our models at https://github. com/google-research/big_vision and hope our research motivates further explorations in improving the quality and ef\ufb01ciency of language-image pre-training.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study, however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the pass@\\textit{k} metric with large values of \\textit{k} to explore the reasoning capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \\emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$ values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models. Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards, therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model, different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

On top of the core table experience extra features like summary stats, histograms, smart sampling, auto-cleaning, and a low code UI are added. All of the functionality has sensible defaults that can be overridden to customize the experience for your workflow.",

For a given PyTorch program, Mirage automatically searches the space of potential GPU kernels that are functionally equivalent to the input program and discovers highly-optimized kernel candidates. This approach allows Mirage to find new custom kernels that outperform existing expert-designed ones.",

Rank1 demonstrates the applicability within retrieval of using a reasoning language model (i.e. OpenAI's o1, Deepseek's R1, etc.) for distillation in order to rapidly improve the performance of a smaller model. We gather and open-source a dataset of more than 600,000 examples of R1 reasoning traces from queries and passages in MS MARCO. Models trained on this dataset show: (1) state-of-the-art performance on advanced reasoning and instruction following datasets; (2) work remarkably well out of distribution due to the ability to respond to user-input prompts; and (3) have explainable reasoning chains that can be given to users or RAG-based systems. Further, we demonstrate that quantized versions of these models retain strong performance while using less compute/memory. Overall, Rank1 shows that test-time compute allows for a fundamentally new type of explainable and performant reranker model for search.",

To train Promptriever, we curate and release a new instance-level instruction training set from MS MARCO, spanning nearly 500k instances. Promptriever not only achieves strong performance on standard retrieval tasks, but also follows instructions. We observe: (1) large gains (reaching SoTA) on following detailed relevance instructions (+14.3 p-MRR / +3.1 nDCG on FollowIR), (2) significantly increased robustness to lexical choices/phrasing in the query+instruction (+12.9 Robustness@10 on InstructIR), and (3) the ability to perform hyperparameter search via prompting to reliably improve retrieval performance (+1.4 average increase on BEIR). Promptriever demonstrates that retrieval models can be controlled with prompts on a per-query basis, setting the stage for future work aligning LM prompting techniques with information retrieval.",

However, most existing studies utilize models that predate recent advances in large language models (LLMs). This study seeks to explore potential improvements that state-of-the-art LLMs can bring. We conduct a comprehensive study, fine-tuning the latest LLaMA model both as a dense retriever (RepLLaMA) and as a pointwise reranker (RankLLaMA) for both passage retrieval and document retrieval using the MS MARCO datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of large language models indeed surpasses that of smaller models. Additionally, since LLMs can inherently handle longer contexts, they can represent entire documents holistically, obviating the need for traditional segmenting and pooling strategies. Furthermore, evaluations on BEIR demonstrate that our RepLLaMA-RankLLaMA pipeline exhibits strong zero-shot effectiveness. Model checkpoints from this study are available on HuggingFace.",

In this second iteration, we extend the original image-text training objective with several prior, independently developed techniques into a unified recipe -- this includes captioning-based pretraining, self-supervised losses (self-distillation, masked prediction) and online data curation. With these changes, SigLIP 2 models outperform their SigLIP counterparts at all model scales in core capabilities, including zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and transfer performance when extracting visual representations for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Furthermore, the new training recipe leads to significant improvements on localization and dense prediction tasks. We also train variants which support multiple resolutions and preserve the input's native aspect ratio. Finally, we train on a more diverse data-mixture that includes de-biasing techniques, leading to much better multilingual understanding and improved fairness. To allow users to trade off inference cost with performance, we release model checkpoints at four sizes: ViT-B (86M), L (303M), So400m (400M), and g (1B).",

        "summary": "Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models on most of today's NLP tasks and benchmarks. Yet, the community is only slowly adopting these models for text embedding tasks, which require rich contextualized representations. In this work, we introduce LLM2Vec, a simple unsupervised approach that can transform any decoder-only LLM into a strong text encoder. LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling bidirectional attention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3) unsupervised contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM2Vec by applying it to 4 popular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 8B parameters and evaluate the transformed models on English word- and sequence-level tasks. We outperform encoder-only models by a large margin on word-level tasks and reach a new unsupervised state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB). Moreover, when combining LLM2Vec with supervised contrastive learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB among models that train only on publicly available data (as of May 24, 2024). Our strong empirical results and extensive analysis demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively transformed into universal text encoders in a parameter-efficient manner without the need for expensive adaptation or synthetic GPT-4 generated data.",

        "summary": "Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.",

        "summary": "Deep learning architectures for supervised learning on tabular data range from simple multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to sophisticated Transformers and retrieval-augmented methods. This study highlights a major, yet so far overlooked opportunity for designing substantially better MLP-based tabular architectures. Namely, our new model TabM relies on efficient ensembling, where one TabM efficiently imitates an ensemble of MLPs and produces multiple predictions per object. Compared to a traditional deep ensemble, in TabM, the underlying implicit MLPs are trained simultaneously, and (by default) share most of their parameters, which results in significantly better performance and efficiency. Using TabM as a new baseline, we perform a large-scale evaluation of tabular DL architectures on public benchmarks in terms of both task performance and efficiency, which renders the landscape of tabular DL in a new light. Generally, we show that MLPs, including TabM, form a line of stronger and more practical models compared to attention- and retrieval-based architectures. In particular, we find that TabM demonstrates the best performance among tabular DL models. Then, we conduct an empirical analysis on the ensemble-like nature of TabM. We observe that the multiple predictions of TabM are weak individually, but powerful collectively. Overall, our work brings an impactful technique to tabular DL and advances the performance-efficiency trade-off with TabM -- a simple and powerful baseline for researchers and practitioners.",

        "summary": "Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical conditions is needed. This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more reliable alternative otherwise.",

We use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not improve first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics) and oracle context helps an LLM generator generate a high-quality RAG answer. We hope FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable, and uncontaminated IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks.",

While previous models in the Phi family largely distill the capabilities of a teacher model (specifically GPT-4), phi-4 substantially surpasses its teacher model on STEM-focused QA capabilities, giving evidence that our data-generation and post-training techniques go beyond distillation. Despite minimal changes to the phi-3 architecture, phi-4 achieves strong performance relative to its size -- especially on reasoning-focused benchmarks -- due to improved data, training curriculum, and innovations in the post-training scheme.",

        "summary": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is an approach that has advanced research and applications in computer vision, fueling modern recognition systems and generative models. We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its data and not the model architecture or pre-training objective. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3% on ViT-B models. Scaling to 1B data, while maintaining the same training budget, attains 72.4%. Our observations hold across various model sizes, exemplified by ViT-H achieving 80.5%, without any bells-and-whistles. Curation code and training data distribution on metadata is made available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP.",

        "summary": "The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation. However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks. However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.",

The embeddings of all other tokens are also computed but then discarded, wasting resources. In this paper, we propose the Token-Independent Text Encoder (TITE) as a more efficient modification of the backbone encoder model. Using an attention-based pooling technique, TITE iteratively reduces the sequence length of hidden states layer by layer so that the final output is already a single sequence representation vector. Our empirical analyses on the TREC 2019 and 2020 Deep Learning tracks and the BEIR benchmark show that TITE is on par in terms of effectiveness compared to standard bi-encoder retrieval models while being up to 3.3 times faster at encoding queries and documents.

        "summary": "Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors, especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.",

        "summary": "Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives, and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.",

Then we construct a hybrid TRM and a cross-encoder reranker by contrastive learning. Evaluations show that our text encoder outperforms the same-sized previous state-of-the-art XLM-R. Meanwhile, our TRM and reranker match the performance of large-sized state-of-the-art BGE-M3 models and achieve better results on long-context retrieval benchmarks. Further analysis demonstrate that our proposed models exhibit higher efficiency during both training and inference. We believe their efficiency and effectiveness could benefit various researches and industrial applications.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in general language tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains a challenge. Current method like Domain Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) requires costly full-parameter training and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces substantial inference latency due to expensive nearest-neighbor searches and longer context. This paper introduces Memory Decoder, a plug-and-play pretrained memory that enables efficient domain adaptation without changing the original model's parameters. Memory Decoder employs a small transformer decoder that learns to imitate the behavior of an external non-parametric retriever. Once trained, Memory Decoder can be seamlessly integrated with any pretrained language model that shares the same tokenizer, requiring no model-specific modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that Memory Decoder enables effective adaptation of various Qwen and Llama models to three distinct specialized domains: biomedicine, finance, and law, reducing perplexity by an average of 6.17 points. Overall, Memory Decoder introduces a novel paradigm centered on a specially pretrained memory component designed for domain-specific adaptation. This memory architecture can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner, consistently enhancing performance across multiple models within the target domain.",
